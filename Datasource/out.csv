Rudyard Kipling’s “The White Mans Burden”,misc,Mr_DWolford,2015,40,,"Take up the White Man's burden--
Send forth the best ye breed--
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild--
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.

Take up the White Man's burden--
In patience to abide,
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
An hundred times made plain
To seek another's profit,
And work another's gain.

Take up the White Man's burden--
The savage wars of peace--
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.
Take up the White Man's burden--
No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper--
The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter,
The roads ye shall not tread,
Go mark them with your living,
And mark them with your dead.

Take up the White Man's burden--
And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard--
The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--
""Why brought he us from bondage,
Our loved Egyptian night?""

Take up the White Man's burden--
Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloke your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.
Take up the White Man's burden--
Have done with childish days--
The lightly proferred laurel,
The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
Through all the thankless years
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,
The judgment of your peers!",720849,en,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1697817458

No child left behind for being profiled
No smiles in every picture pitchin’ coke vials
Imagine babies being born with a black mask
And the bulls-eye birthmark on our black ass
The officer Loehmann shot Tamir that fast
Four hundred years of fear appeared in the gat blast
They ain’t tell us we'd be murdered by the polícia
Ooh child, they said things were gonna get easier
They ain’t tell us we be crucified in the media
Turned into a hashtag, highlights on Wikipedia
The rich get greedier, the poor more needier
The hood seedier, lock us up instead of freein’ us
Who speaks for us? We ain’t listenin’ when you preach to us
So concerned when we can only learn what you teachin' us
If love is a lap dance and hip-hop is rap bands

Is every childhood for black babies?
Criminalized at birth, they call us crack babies, that’s crazy
But we ain’t never heard them talk about a meth child
White supremacy means always havin’ the best child
Why they hand us to death style with a fresh smile?
Man, tell me how to protect child from projectiles?
We need God to bless a child with a vest now
How we bein’ raised if followed by days of let downs?
See we inherited ideals that our parents lived
Taught us to go to war then they treat us like we terrorists
Then act all shocked when it’s babies we buryin’
But killin’ for what you want is just bein’ American
They teach us to worship Jesus but curse his speeches
But whitewashing the savior just made them the worst believers
Then point to the flag and tell us to pledge allegiance
To a place they still treat us like a stillborn fetus
Believe it

Heaven Tells No Lies,rock,Helloween,2007,439,,"I could go a step ahead and try
Harder than before but I deny
Always when I try a step
Something's gonna hold me back
Back to where I started
I just bump my head instead
Better leave me here all on my own
Better leave me or become my clone
Everyone who grabbed my hand
Fell into the same wasteland
Don't try to convince me with your optimistic smile

I'd need a shotgun in my dreams tonight
To terminate my rotten side
Just need one shot into the center of my hate
To light the darkness and run free
From that old spell

I don't know if hell or paradise
Belong together or if Heaven Tells No Lies
You role the dice
You know the price is higher than you can afford
Beware of what you might see
Can you trust your blinded eyes?
I don't know if Heaven tells no lies
Black is white and colours turn to grey
What was close is drifting far away
Just now right's already wrong
What turns weak was never strong
Can I kill the demon without blowing out my mind?

Call me if you need me though, I be on the Northside
Probably leave intoxicated lightly toasted or high
But you shouldn't follow me cause where I go is dangerous
Party hard with zombies and all that brain was made for us

I heard that you would slow my drive hoping I would crash up
But then you'd eventually see my hustle praying for us to mash-up
Well, Fuck you hater I've evolved
I'm never gonna let you (pass this)
You like that? Feel it



He told me I was really, coming too aggressive
Maybe overconfident choosing few suggestions
But I don't really need it, cause I'm fuckin' impressive
I focus on my checks, blood and sweat really stress me
Moving like it's wrestling, hold it, question?
If you wanna get just like me
Shouldn't you have learned your lessons
Thou shall not never fuck with I
Especially against my grind mode
Then stand me in front of a firing squad
With A Cigarello and a blindfold

Dead... For The Moment,pop,The Bronx Casket Co.,2001,96,,"Life keeps growing, boundaries falling, it's knocking me in my grave
And if I recover, I find I discover, it's me that's become its slave
Pushed from the mountain, lost in a free fall, waiting for black to come
The sound of the splatter can be heard forever, ending what I've become
I can take you by the hand
I can lead you through this land
But when the hangman comes to call, it's up to you to stand or fall
Oh, it's just my heart that's breaking
Oh, it's just my soul you taking
Cast aside with self-inflicted pain
No one dies from broken dreams
And when you're dead who hears you scream
How much could this corpse feel anyway
Dead for the moment
Pile it on me, stack it to heaven, can't make a dead man stay
He looks so peaceful, hard to believe a fire is on its way
I won't be here long, this box is just too small, won't break but I can bend
I'm painting it all black to mark this arrival, wake up... it's time again
Try to keep yourself alive, even if you're dead inside
And if you follow, take the lead
There's only so much you can bleed
Over and over breaking out of these chains
Lost in the moment trying to beat this same old game
Who will be there when I put out my hand
Who will be there and what will be the cost

Things have a way of working out when everything seems lost",1140653,en,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1697817458

It's always the way, that you'll soon find out
Someone's not what they seemed at first

Sick of cold stares and freezing words
Dragged along till there's nothing left
I'd given all that I had to someone nothing like you
This time I'm here till my last breath
I need someone to come back to
But most of all that person needs to be you

I feel I've wasted away what I cherish now
It's been a long few years and I don't know how
I've wasted a feeling I'm about to drown in with you
I need someone to come back to
But must of all that person needs to be you
This feels like a different heart
Because now this feels so real
Being miles away every single day
Never felt like such a thrill

It can feel so shit, but what can you do
As every time I'm back, I'm coming back for you
And that's the way I want it after everything I do

People in the less of a two month span
Not playin', couple is on record, the others I'm not saying
I was wild since the box of sand
I was the fucking slap-box man
You was rocking the Real Roxanne
You can go ahead with your battling man
I get mad at cha man
Hit you in your head with a battering ram
Rap like only an african can
They can lock us up trying to kill us all or put crack in our hand
But you gotta understand, that their is a plan to kill off the black man
And how the black woman the number one catcher of aids
And we all know that bullshit spreaded from gays
Its so craze, my mental being in an intricate maze
Can't eat can't sleep without hitting some haze
Seen bright nights and dark days
And maybe wanna run and spark the gate
And pray to God I ain't marked for a grave
Cause I ain't even saved



Yo, Keep it all real; I don't care if you don't like me
I'm in this game for more than a chain or whipping a crisp pair of nikes
See there's more to it
It's kinda of hard to get it but easier to lose it
Thats why I try to keep it
Some cats died to reach it
Don't even know what they're reaching for
If they don't listen then why we teaching for
And my moms still teaching more
I gotta question why she get paid the least for her profession
And my pops still stressing
Got a new heart
Turned around got cancer in the skin
I swear he can't win
But he don't quit my old man he just keep grinding to the end
And the ends coming know time quick
Cause me and him, still kick it on some old time shit

One Day We Will All B Free,rock,Prince,2021,1818,,"
Ooh ooh


You go to bed just to learn
It was all a dream
Day after day just a yearnin'
For something in between
Kneeling down beside your bed
Praying for a sign
And everything your mama said
Is just a waste of time


But one day, one day
We'll all be free


You go to church just to be sold
Why you deserve to die
It's just like having your fortune told
But never asking why
Or more like having one of God's creations
Tied up on a leash (Uh-uh)
Makes you wonder who controls the nations
If we never had peace

One day, one day
We'll all be free


Ooh-ooh


You go to school just to learn
About what never existed
But if your history only burns
It's better to resist it
Keepin' it Franklin, Benjamin Banneker
Was never born a slave
And-ah if George Washington never told no lie
Maybe we'd all be saved


One day, one day
We'll all be free


One day, one day
We'll all be free
One day, one day
We'll all be free
One day, one day
We'll all be free

One day, one day
We will all be free


One day, one day
We will all be free (Oh, yes we will, yes we will)
One day, one day (One day, one glorious day)
We will all be free
One day, one day
We will all be free (Talking about you, talking about me)
One day, one day
We will all be free (One day, one day, we will all be, all be free)
One day, one day
We will all be",6683658,en,https://images.genius.com/772b4ce42b7f5498c382243790752a31.1000x1000x1.jpg
Send in the Clowns,pop,Elisabeth Andreassen,1992,44,,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground, you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around, one who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped
Opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again, with my usual flair
Sure of my line
No one is there

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Quick send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here
What a surprise
Who could foresee?
I'd come to feel about you what you felt about me?
Why only now I see that you've drifted away?
What a surprise
What a cliché

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns

Approaching Doom,rock,Urgehal,2009,118,,"Demonic whips upon a funeral black night sky
Corpsecold soil beneath our cloven hooves
Church fires enlightens the left hand path
Like torches from hell devouring the cross

Thou shall worship Him with fire and blood
Sacrifice thy flesh to the horned god
Fulfill the infernal pacts through the black arts
Signed and drenched in sacrificial blood

For each step my mind grows darker
For each kill my soul grows stronger
Preparing for the apocalyptic war
Through satanic rituals and sorcery

Perform the rites of necromancy
Evoke the unhallowed dead
In sadistic black mass perversions
We seal the oath of the goat

Carve his symbol in thy flesh
Bleed for the lords of hell
Declare war upon the heavens
Kill in His name
Behold His coming",1210318,en,https://images.genius.com/318ac858734365d1d3bf62ead96e6f77.225x225x1.jpg

Remain RMC Remix,pop,MUTEMATH,2016,124,,"
I’ve been dreaming
Dreaming of a day in the end
Waiting for someone
To wake me from the dream that I’m in
I’ve been confiscating
Every shred of hope that I can
I keep on mistaking
The future for the places I’ve been


Always the same
Always forever we remain
Always the same
I’m dying just to keep my place


I’ve been breaking
And repairing everything that I make
Just to feel important
And worth the little space that I take
I keep on delaying
Everything I’d rather avoid
Rapidly decaying
And panicking I’m losing the choice

Always the same
Always forever we remain
Always the same
I’m dying just to keep my place


Just keep on trying
Just keep fighting
Just keep going
Just keep surviving
Just keep walking
Just keep breathing
Just keep holding
Just keep believing


Always the same
Always forever we remain
Always the same
I’m dying just to keep my place

Always...

Just keep fighting
Just keep going
Just keep surviving
Just keep walking
Just keep breathing
Just keep holding
Just keep believing

I think i'm losing all this sight of you and me

The rain just feels so lonely without you here
I keep dancing with these spirits when I keep fading
Sometimes I think of you so i can forget my fears
But then the thought of you just leaving makes me scared

Waking up these days feels like a dream
The thought of this existence is now distorted

When they met up again

But in the morning light
He was out of sight

How does the victim become the victor in the sequel

She'll find the strength to say goodbye

Together as One Live in Eindhoven,rock,Death,2001,6,,"
Labelled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance


Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul


Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy


Together - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun


Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a, a bond of flesh


Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hеarts, one soul


Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy


Togеther - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die

Sharpened Swords,rock,Elegos,2016,21,,"Darkness slowly embraces the hills
Drops of daylight guide them to their destiny
It has been foretold by great men of the past
Kings and soldiers who fought and died protecting this land

An army is marching with iron will
Brothers thirsty for vengeance
Upon an enemy who disgraced their crown
Sharpened swords and fearless souls will fall

Like ghosts in the middle of the night they will attack
Clad in black sky and warded by the wind
Souls of kinsmen who met an honorable death
Shine the path leading the way to eternal glory

This day history would be written
Heroic deeds would live forever
New elegies would be sang
Telling the story of thousands brave warriors

Under the moonlight the battle begins
When morning comes, none should draw breath
They stand their ground though outnumbered
Steel on steel, sword on shield, victory is near
No fear, no retreat, only death upon their foes

Until darkness slowly embraces the hills",3150147,en,https://images.genius.com/aaed7dbc23e05e9fc438ba62d182d81f.295x295x1.jpg

I Could Do Better,pop,Cole Thomas,2020,18,,"
She don't like coffee, but I do
She says it's always a little too strong
She don't like her paintings, but I do
They're the best I've ever seen
But she says I'm wrong

She gets tired around 9:30
So we make our plans during the day
To her my humor's a little too dirty
But if you'd ask me, I'd say it's okay


Never seen a person care so much
Whether not I'm okay
But my unappreciativeness
Might make her go away
Breakin', bakin' my green tea
She takes care of me
When it comes to return the favor
I could do better
Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Whoa
I could do better

Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Whoa


From here on out, it's cuddlin' by the fire
Makin' sure she never gets cold
But that's impossible 'cause she's always freezin'
Warmin' her up never gets old

'Stead of raisin' my voice, I just say I'm sorry
'Stead of realizin' I'm wrong down the road
'Cause you don't deserve to have any tears in your eyes
And I'm sick and tired of being the reason you cry

With shadows
Smiles as friend
Touch a lover too
He takes him the child to kiss him

And silent, the stage glares empty ;
And the blood tide, on the bitter shore
Sweeps over the mind till morning

Caught me some Ls but it
Taught me a lesson

Get to rehearsal
Barely scratching the surface
Thinking back to days when

Started writing rhymes said
It gave him a purpose
One day I spit a sermon
At the sunday service
People tell stories still
Dont know my version
Look to last year when
This shit was a burden
Growing up the underdog
Is so uncertain
Dont even check behind
The curtain cause

In my bag not a birkin
All in type of person

Burns the words upon our lips
Talking sh*t in tongues
Mingle in the sopping lungs
Oh this descent to doom and gloom
Set before a tune for two
This last waltz is all
These two left feet of mine

The Tower Accidentally Released On Steam Early,misc,Game Genius,2014,16,,"A mistake made by a member of the game The Tower's moderation team made the game released yesterday, just about seven months before it's intended full release in 2015. It was originally marked as an Early Access game, as it was unfinished. Anyone who uses Steam understand the feedback system developers use when putting their game on Early Access. Sadly, the game was put in Steam’s New Releases with the tag of five US dollars attached.This is what game developer Dante Knoxx of the project had to say...Oh, Christ! I recently gave Zakk access to our back-end as a Moderator, so I could concentrate on working flat-out and remove some of the community strain from my work load, and the fool has released us seven months early!!"" he wrote, adding that he's asked Valve to help undo the release.

""This many people aren't supposed to see us until The Tower 2015 edition is ready to launch :( may actually have  damaged something because of this.

This version of the game, ""The Tower: 2015 Edition,"" is actually a remake of an earlier version, ""The Tower: 2012 Edition."" And now I suppose it's The Tower: 2014 Edition.After the game was put back in Early Access, Dante Knoxx seemed to be glad and said ""We're officially back on Early Access. Sorry about that folks! :D"". What do you guys think? Did the release actually hurt the the games development or did it bring more awareness to the Steam-based project?",470794,en,https://images.genius.com/8a250cb362bb5a346a1f7e4adbdf1581.220x220x1.png

I gripped it all

Trying to reach the sun
Let them run, run, run
Only you, only you
Can lead the way
A sizzling of the tongue
And you won't let them run
Only you, only you
Can lead the way

Rest in somewhere deep in the sheets
Lies two lightheads and the let loose thoughts
Floating abroad lens they sought
Tiny bubbles pop, close by night
As the water 'round us walks with ties
Some of them trying side
But we breathe with our minds
But we breathe with our minds
Trying to reach the sun

Only you, only you
Can lead the way
A sizzling of the time

Start the clock fire the gun
I'll wait to see who will outrun

And the magic gets stronger that keeps us from seeing in

Perfect coach perfect stare
Perfect speech perfect flair
Perfect chill perfect scare

Breathing air, let's play some truth or dare

Waking up, a dream of love and soul
Beauty shining like a million suns

You put a hoe before yo homies - we can never be friends
You turnin' state on yo homies - we can never be friends

I was raised around dope & crack fiends, stranglers & triple beams
You can not imagine all tha shit that a nigga seen
Now I done seen niggas get they head busted for nothin'
They leave & come back stuntin' like they bout it & wasn't
Better watch them some nigga or stop them some nigga
This a nigga wit a black hooded & pops them a nigga
The people came thru & they done kicked in my Ma's do'
They tore up my Ma's house & questioned my folks
My momma stood up & said ""Ain't no Lac here
Get yo dogs, get tha fuck out & don't come back here""
I'm tired of runnin', I can't turn back, I hear tha sirens comin'
Now they can give a lovely fuck why I done it
An all they need to prove is that I fired somethin'
Or hit 9 lil' children
My partna got killed & they say I'm the gunman
You fuckin' right I know him & fuckin' right I done him




(Look)
I was tha first nigga out tha click wit a cuban connect
An tha first to push a six thru tha Nolia project
I broke bread wit all my niggas gave 'em tha prices I get
Turn the projects to condeminiums & diamonds to begets
Was tha first to go to feds, I left my two month old daughter
Her momma said since I left my friends ain't passed a quater
When I rolled out same niggas was in my face again
Like "" Stone you out early, man we thought you got ten""
We kicked tha bo bo, swapped lies, given hugs & dap
But you know hugs ain't love, niggas is checkin' for straps
Each one of them owein' me a dub, ain't even mention tha snaps
I knew then it was bad blood, I'm bout to twist some caps
Gun in hand, I'm eatin' grits, I ain't done this in awhile
I see one in a blue sedan sharin' kisses & smiles
I creep up on him, popped tha van, ran thru tha crowd
Hit tha corner of Washington then I popped up his house



(Yo, yo)
I keep a four pound cocked wit hollows in tha chamber
Been a real lil' nigga since a B-G banger
Plus I'm down wit tha killas no matter red or blue
An too bad I can't say tha same shit bout you
Cause you's a bitch nigga dawg & square as a preist
An you's a snitch nigga dawg cause you told tha police
I hold trial in tha streets & keep it gangsta fa sho
An tha only niggas run to tha law is a hoe
So you was all about tha rah rah shit back then
But yo money ain't long & you know you can't win
Your boy Mack a shot caller & if you hate me I feel you
Cause I got enough bread to pay yo homies to kill you
Yo I can kick back, fuck, & have fun all year
An you can snitch, watch your back, & you can still disappear
An while you P-C up I stay mashin' for dollas

Trench Poets,misc,BY EDGELL RICKWORD,2018,21,,"I knew a man, he was my chum,
but he grew blacker every day,
and would not brush the flies away,
nor blanch however fierce the hum
of passing shells; I used to read,
to rouse him, random things from Donne—
like “Get with child a mandrake-root.”
But you can tell he was far gone,
for he lay gaping, mackerel-eyed,
and stiff, and senseless as a post
even when that old poet cried
“I long to talk with some old lover’s ghost.”

I tried the Elegies one day,
But he, because he heard me say:
“What needst thou have no more covering than a man?”
grinned nastily, and so I knew
the worms had got his brains at last.
There was one thing that I might do
to starve the worms; I racked my head
for healthy things and quoted Maud.
His grin got worse and I could see
he sneered at passion’s purity.
He stank so badly, though we were great chums
I had to leave him; then rats ate his thumbs.",4037308,en,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1697817458

And clouds to hide aeroplanes

Thrown over the wall again (2x)

Interpret sadness as shame
We swung a hammer and teach them to believe
Bury the lead behind a frame

Thrown over the wall again

Thrown over the wall, thrown over the wall

Broken glass in your all thinner rate
City is a pass
Or maybe not

From my place to your embrace
Show what you got
Hello?
Hello?
It's always rising in the phone
And we'll deal certainty of it all
Last of your kind are you still hard?
Show what you got

We use the sea to hide our submarines
Disguise our faces with names
We use the night to come seal our dreams
And clouds to hide aeroplanes

Flood likes to cover the sun

Now wasn't that the same little gal you swore a while back
You'd spend your whole life through
And shortly after that didn't she hang it up for life to marry you

Well secretary's and alligator shoes got in your blood

You’d better mind your better homes and gardens and take the kids out too
And take her home some candy and say baby I love you

But you're bout half smart and you better start and that just might get ya back in

You say you're getting caught up early you're cheated out of life
Well you also said that you'd be a millionaire by the time you're twenty-five
Didn’t make it

Spend the day with the PTA she might think that’s cool

Complimentary Muffin Live in London,rock,Flight of the Conchords,2019,815,,"So, as well as our doing
A collection of songs tonight

We're gonna tell you some of our--
Our rock and roll anecdotes

Give you a sort of a
Behind-the-scenes look

At, uh, you know
The life of the band

Jemaine: You know, some pretty
Funny experiences that we've had

-some pretty crazy ones as well
-Yeah

And I think one that encompasses
Both those, um, subsets...
I don't know
I don't think ""subsets""

Is a very rock and roll
Way of describing it

Jemaine: That's what
We're talking about, the fun...

The fun rock and roll subset

Um...
Uh, the story--

The story that Jemaine
Is talking about

-I think, is the muffin story
-Oh, yes!

Yeah. Um, this is
A story of, um...

The time when I got
To my hotel room--
Oh, no, sorry. Let me give
A bit of context

Wait. Hold on
Everyone listen to Bret

Okay

Okay, so
First of all, being in a band

We stay in hotels
'cause we tour around

-We stay in some quite fancy hotels
-Oh, yes

We've stayed in some Premiere Inns

Yeah, absolutely

And we've stayed in some of the
Very Best Westerns out there

And I got to my room
And there was a complimentary
Muffin sitting on the table

Okay, this is where the fun--

You guys obviously don't stay in these
Fancy hotels

-'cause this is very unusual
-Some of you are a few steps ahead

You're like, okay, this is
Where the fun's beginning

-Yeah
-Yep

So, I thought, okay, if I've
Got a complimentary muffin

I bet old Mad Dog's got
A complimentary muffin

That's my nickname
I'll tell you about that later

But tell them the joke about
The complimentary muffin

Okay, yeah, sure. Okay, so
The complimentary muffin, now

It's not a muffin that says, ""Oh
Hello, Bret, you look good today.""

It's a complimentary muffin

-But...
-Yeah

Imagine that though
Imagine that

-That's ridiculous
-It's such a fun...

A very flattering pastry

Little blueberry eyes

You know, just looking up at you
Going...

-Absolutely adorable
-I'd eat that

It's just looking up at you, going

""Well, you've got a nice personality
Little muffin

That's just a little
Digression we add in to--

Yeah, we just, like, spice up
The story with a bit of humor

Yeah. Um...

It wasn't something that
Occurred to us at the time

And so, I thought if I've got
A complimentary muffin

I bet Mad Dog here's got one, and...

Right. You're probably wondering
Why I get called ""Mad Dog.""

Bret: This is a
Nickname that caught on

When Jemaine e-mailed me with
The subject ""New Nickname.""

I'm not sure if
That's the start of it

I'm sure it was a series of events

No, well, it was
A series of e-mails

It was-- Yeah. Three or
Four e-mails reminding me

And then, eventually, it caught
On, and now, I've got it up here

It's not important to the story
About how I got the name

I've got a reputation, and they
Call me Mad Dog, within the band

And so, I thought--

I called his room, and I'd
Only been in the room

Maybe like, two or three minutes
You know, me and my muffin

And I call up Jemaine's room
I mean, Mad Dog, and, um...

-Thank you
-He answers the phone

""Hello?""

He's already bloody halfway
Through that muffin

Yeah

Bloody Keith Richards over here

God

I didn't-- I didn't even wait
As soon as I saw it, rawr!

What'd you do?
Just walk in there like

""Rawr, give me that
I'll do that!"" Bloody...

Yeah, basically
That's pretty much it

He wasn't even there
And he guessed it

-because I'm a mad dog
-And...

You start to get a picture of the
Life of excess that we live

Jemaine: For you to know
It's a life of excess

You need to also know that
We had muffins for breakfast

That's right, yeah

So that's bloody two muffins
In one day. Oh!

-Double muffiner
-Oh, God

-Yeah
-Yeah

And so, we collect these
Stories as we travel 'round

You never know when something
Crazy's gonna happen

Yeah!
That one was about seven years ago

Broke,rap,The MC Correct,2017,28,,":

Sittin' with a dutch that i just rolled up
In the car hoping 5-0 don't show up
Always stuck in the future, thinking 'bout the distant
So i miss the present but I'll get it next Christmas
Marijuana/mediaction really what's the difference
No such thing alchohol as a  prescription
Take over your mind, that's a complex mission
Spit over these beats like automatic ammunition, listen
I'm the boss now i made executive decisions
I didn't get anywhere just praying and wishing
I said I'ma get it done and now i'm bumping in your system
Dedication,never hatin'
And they waiting patiently for the day they can get to me
Cause with the heat i spit it keeps'em at bay but eventually...
Until then i'm still breaking the beat
Grind it up like Gs that they roll in the street
That's CORRECT
No I ain't play with them
I stayed inside lyrics dripped from my pen
In my mind i know every line is a sin
But my rhymes are so nice i rewind them and then
All my pride is convinced, i really spit gems
I compacted the flow now i really get it in
So i guess
Only diamonds when i'm rhyming
And if you smoke bud then we can be friends

I could write about the typical.. i'm from a poor... crime filled neighborhood...raised by a single mother don't know my dad blah blah it's cliche...this here... this... this is... this is creative... this shows that i'm different...(different)

:
I just feel like i can't take no more
Cause i'm already broke, can't break no more
We just feel like we can't take no more
Cause we're already broke, can't break no more
No more, no more, no more, no more (no more, no more)
No more, no more, no more, no more (no more)
No more (no no no)
I just feel like i can't take no more
Cause i'm already broke, can't break no more
We just feel like we can't take no more (can't take it)
Cause we're already broke, can't break no more
No more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more

:
I'm back on the beat, back on my feet
Ain't have a job i was back on these streets
I was baggin' them Gs this is madness to me
All of these ashes just happen to be
Not from tabacco, but yea it's a leaf
Light that shit man I need some relief
You'll smoke more than one if you're smoking with me
I'm not addicted I just know what I need
Here we go, i'm about that action
I do what you won't and that's why i'm the captain
I'm talking coast to coast, people know i'm rapping
I'ma go for broke, i'ma make it happen
No time for games unless i'm playing madden
No time for lames ya gotta be down
My whole crew about to run this town
Killed our fears nothin' to run from now
All my haters trippin like i won't make a livin
Off puttin them to sleep, like i was a dentist
You ain't get it, got a pencil in my left fist
Check this, you already know i'm wreckless

Open your mind and wipe eternal sleep off your faded eyes enveloped in the ignorance

And our despair causes the global fear which gains its power

Forms the new politics of terror
And dictates its own will to you

Remnants of souls will suffocate in blazing fire of genocide!

You hear new command from the jaws of war and
Your blinded mind is reprogrammed
To kill
To destroy
To sell your own feelings
Just to be a silent puppet in their hands!

It twists your flesh with its sharpened claws
You've got no life

Stay Down,rap,A Too Lyrical,2021,17,Fy Furioso,"Hook
I'm just trynna stay down till I come up
I be on the grind working when the sun up
Cause I remember all them days I was dead broke
Now I’m trynna find myself gotta find hope

Back then they ain't believe in me
Now they all wanna be with me
Cause they know that Im focused
And now everybody notice



Verse
I'm staying down cause I remember times when I took a lost
When I wanted to be up these haters want me to fall
They wasn’t picking up the phone when I gave em a call
Now I'm coppin me some forces when I hop in the mall

I had to clean up and save me some bread
I was down on my last I had to worry about getting ahead
This ain't where I wanna be but I'm planning now
Gotta watch your day ones cause they the ones that count you out
I pay em no mind cause at the end I got a family to feed
I'm a kid myself that's why I'm not planning a seed
I need me a vaca so I'm planning to breathe
I’m making moves on my own these haters hating on me

But I watch out
They just take my kindness for weakness that’s a cop out
They gon start blowing up my phone when I pop out
When I pull that brand new 2021 drop out

Verse 2

Ayo, loyalty is thin and I know that
So if you cross me you loss me ***** I don't go back

For them M's keep ya friends in the lens like Kodak
Know that I heard the rumors and the back biting
I'm back writing I'm a dog and they cat fighting
I snap like it in they feelings and they back typing
I’m real they ain't real they just act like it
Perpetrators, impostors I'm wit the playas and mobsters
Man the game ain't the same so I change up my roster
Man I hang wit my choppa and I think of my father
And I think of blackin' out when I'm drinking this vodka

Johanna said there is a better way than losing my mind on alcohol
I didn't yell in her face like I wanted to
It's pretty hard to behave myself when I can't find my way at all
Stumblin' down 14th Street with something to prove


Tried to love for a stretch thinking hearts could be true
I learned after a time that's not something you choose


Downtown is where I've gotta be cuz that's where the most women are
At least the kind of girls I wanna find
I wanna party all night long but not inside of a crowded bar
I need something to get her off of my mind


I'll take some drugs for a stretch then drink some booze
I'm resigned in my mind to thoughts that are cruel


I don't wanna be told to stop blaming
I don't wanna be told to stop taking drugs
I don't wanna be told to stop drinking alcohol

A Sense of Direction - Part 1: Berlin,misc,Gideon Lewis-Kraus,2014,645,Rebecca Saletan,"It was 2007, and I couldn’t remember the last time I’d done anything that felt exciting or youthful or new. I bought a ticket to visit an old friend who’d been living in Berlin for six years, paying a hundred euros a month to live in an unrenovated prewar apartment. Delia had a wide balcony and no discernible line of work. It was midsummer, when Berlin endures only three or four hours of actual darkness, and the air is soft and heavy with desire, clear with vast possibility. In the early evenings we lolled around, drinking cheap beer on the overgrown grass fringe of the canal in the stalled sunset radiance, thick with the scent of untamed green, and later we went out, each night until long past dawn, biking all over the city with a rotating cast of international dubiety—paint-spattered people with unidentifiable accents—dancing at Rio, at WMF, at Bar25, at Club der Visionäre, at Weekend, the last of which had just been written up in the most detailed Berlin-is-the-place-of-the-now sally the New York Times had yet produced. I cannot account for what we did during the day, if we did anything at all.

Everyone I encountered in Berlin seemed to have the freedom—economically and culturally—to do exactly what he or she pleased. What was important was what was happening right now. Nobody seemed to hold anybody to account. It wasn’t like San Francisco or New York, where the first question anybody asked at a party was what you did for a living, and the second was where you lived and how much you paid to live there. The other reason was that, perhaps because of that freedom, Berlin felt like the center of something surprising and important, and I couldn’t help thinking it would be a good place for an aspiring writer. The rumors of a new Lost Generation were a terrible cliché, but it was hard to resist them.

I applied for a Fulbright, figuring I could do with at least the imprimatur of institutional legitimacy. My proposal—some essay I planned never to write about contemporary young German novelists, about whom I knew exactly nothing—was the sort of thing I’d been advised the committee wanted to hear, and I got it.

Twenty-seven was an unusual age to move to Berlin, but I’d always had a precocious sense of crisis, and my decision to go was spurred at least in part by my fantasy that I might be able to stave off future regret. I felt like I owed the experience to some subsequent self. Everybody else in Berlin was either twenty-two, just out of leafy liberal arts colleges and in flight from the responsibilities ahead, or they were thirty-nine, just out of a career or a relationship and in flight from the responsibilities behind. For my part, I moved there as a kind of preemptive strike, reasoning that if I bolted while I could, in my late twenties, I wouldn’t bolt when I couldn’t, in my forties, or maybe more specifically at approximately forty-six, when my dad left his marriage and moved in with Brett, a lovely guy he met at the gym, and my brother and I could never get in touch with him about car insurance or baseball games because the two of them were always disappearing to the nightclubs of Key West or Palm Springs. They e-mailed self-portraits in sailor suits from themed Atlantis cruises down Baja. My dad’s justification for this, in those moments when he felt as though he needed to produce one, was that he was claiming the outré adolescence he’d been denied. He’d lived a life long on sacrifice and short on pleasure, and had begun, at last, to live the life he deserved. “Deserved” was his word.

More than anything, his two mistakes—first, not living the life he wanted; and, second, believing this had been a sacrifice that freed him from all future sacrifices, like having dinner with his children when he wanted to stay longer at the bar, or treating their mother with any respect—were what I hoped to avoid. I explained my fear of regret in terms of how unusually clearly my dad’s life—in which a bad, perhaps even cowardly decision made in his twenties became a thirties of anxiety, a forties of resentment, and a fifties of abandon—exemplified the great cost of not having acted as one wished when one still had time.

I thought that perhaps my dad’s problem was that he hadn’t had enough experience, that he’d chosen a career and a marriage before he knew what else was out there, and I didn’t want to make the same error. Experiencewise, I wanted what I thought everybody wanted: to go to secret parties with artist/DJs that people in Brooklyn hadn’t even heard of, or to sleep with as many people as, say, Tom, so that when I got back into a committed relationship it wouldn’t be for the mere sake of being in one but because I’d chosen that person. Those were the reasons I gave for moving to Berlin. Or at least, those were the excuses I gave for moving to Berlin.

I arrived in time for a few days of lingering late summer. I took the U-Bahn from the airport, dropped my stuff at a sublet, spent my first euros on a pack of cigarettes, and walked slowly down the Karl-Marx-Allee toward Delia’s apartment feeling alone and free and already different. My first night in town was Delia’s send-off, which seemed cruelly unfortunate at the time. (Later I understood it was a common enough coincidence: every day somebody arrived and somebody else left.) I arrived at her apartment to find the German national women’s Ultimate Frisbee team running around in their underwear in the living room while the men smoked on the balcony, trying to decide where we’d all go later, if the women decided to put their pants back on.

In Berlin it thus seemed, from that first night’s demented relaxation into morning, as though everything was up in the air at all hours; no possibility was foreclosed. The local custom was to commit to as little as possible, and by “local custom” I do not mean “German custom.” If the twentieth century had taught anybody anything at all, it was that Germans had lousy customs. Hence Berlin’s appeal: there was no cultural arbitration. My colleagues in Paris had the futile errand of trying to resemble the French. Those in Beijing competed in the absurd contest of trying to understand China. In Tokyo, or in London, or in Moscow, your sunlit hours had to have some nontrivial relationship to the economy. Berlin was an experiment in total freedom from authority, an infinitely long weekend with your parents out of town. It felt like an anti-gravity chamber. The old crimes licensed you to ignore the claims of the past; the low cost of living licensed you to ignore the demands of the present; and the future was something that would happen when we moved back to New York, where many of us would once more live in uncomfortable proximity to our actual parents, and where people talked about real estate and restaurants.

It was not that I did not like talking about restaurants. It’s normal to like talking about restaurants. But in Berlin when we talked about restaurants, it was the cheap kebab places; this was part of the ritual by which we acknowledged the aspects of our Berlin existence that differentiated us from our friends at home. We, and now I mean the people I came to love in Berlin, David Levine and Alix and Emilie, often felt like survivors whose home planet had become glutted with condos bought by people who waited in line for cupcakes, and we congratulated ourselves and one another on having gotten out just in time. This gave our decision to do as little of consequence as possible—with this ocean of space and profligacy of hours—the legitimate pretext of cultural and economic protest. We rebelled against the authority of rent and cupcakes.

In theory, this chartered us to do whatever we pleased whenever we wanted. In practice, it meant we spent a lot of time wondering what we wanted to do, and if we wanted to do anything at all. Or maybe that was just me. Part of my anti-regret crusade involved making sure I was always doing just what I felt like, which mostly meant keeping myself open for things that might come up, saying yes to whatever distraction happened along. It was an extremely active kind of passivity and it went swimmingly at night, when things were always coming up: there were gallery openings and bars and clubs, all elbowy with asymmetrical people proving provocative until breakfast. The daytimes were another matter; then it was less clear what the most vital and necessary and memorable experience available might be. I went to Berlin with a whole shelf of unread books, books like Middlemarch, but every time I sat down hungover in a café at eleven a.m. with that copy of Middlemarch, the whole day open before me, I inevitably thought to myself, Why move to Berlin to read Middlemarch? I could read Middlemarch in San Francisco (though, naturally, I hadn’t). The whole point of living in Berlin was being an agent in the world of total possibility. Was reading Middlemarch the thing I most desired to do in that particular hour? It wasn’t easy to say. Ordinarily I had to put the book down and go on a walk to think it over, to make sure I was maximizing the value of my experience. These often turned into some pretty long walks. When I got back to the neighborhood from my walks, I sat around the Turkish bakery with Alix, or I went with her to check out the newer galleries up in Wedding. When I was with Alix, I felt as though there was nothing else in the world I’d rather be doing. When she was busy I went to see Wings of Desire.

Part of the point of Wim Wenders’s 1987 film, which I must’ve seen a dozen times in that first year, is that Berlin before the fall of the Wall had long been an inertial place, a sort of vacuum. There was no industry in the West; factory owners were afraid the Soviets would blockade the city, as they had shortly after the war. The banks were in grimy Frankfurt, technology and automobiles were in bourgeois Munich and arrogant Stuttgart, the press was in wealthy Hamburg, the provisional government in boring Bonn. West Berlin was merely a symbol of resistance, a great series of photo ops, and America was happy to help pay for it as long as it continued to provide such good press. East Berlin was just as unreal. It was a Communist set, the utopian socialism of the future, but it was also a big, expensive mock-up. The rest of the country was bankrupted by the purchase of ornamental tile for the wedding-cake palazzi that lined the Stalinallee (now the Karl-Marx-Allee I walked to Delia’s frisbee-underwear going-away). The Fernsehturm, or TV Tower, at Alexanderplatz, the city’s only height of note, had been built in 1969 as a present to the Volk from their twenty-year-old puppet government. They’d had to use Western technology and Swedish engineers, and the people were already picking up TV signals from the free side of the city. After the Wall went up, in 1961, there was never anything of true geopolitical importance at stake. Its construction wasn’t an escalation but a diffusion: it made the conflict not political but rhetorical, for the benefit of the media.
The movie follows two angels as they bum around the city. One of them becomes smitten with a doleful French trapeze artist, and his feelings for her convince him to leap from eternity into time. Peter Falk, playing himself as a former angel, encourages Damiel’s transition. In the scene where he first wakes up as a mortal, he asks a passerby for help. The man teaches him the words for the colors in the graffiti on the Wall—his life until then had been in black and white—and then gives him change for his first hot coffee and pack of cigarettes. He gulps the black coffee, his eyes wide.

This had always evoked what felt like a disproportionate response in me; it wasn’t the sort of movie that was supposed to make you cry. On some level it was probably just because I was lonely and indecisive, sitting yet again by myself on a Tuesday at one in the afternoon at the Kino Babylon or at the Moviemento, and because it ends with the inevitability of an enduring romance, which already seemed impossibly remote in libertine Berlin. But it wasn’t just that. The citizens of divided Berlin were marooned on an island outside of time. Their ability to do what they wanted to do was thwarted by their historical circumstance. But once they, like the angel, were able to pass through the Wall, they would leave behind their suspended existence and enter the swift current of life.

When the angel wakes up as a mortal, he strides away from the Wall with the assurance and the joy of the convalescent. He’s so giddy to have time—to have finite time, time that now counts for precisely something because its quantity is fixed—that he knows just how he’s going to use it. I’d been so entranced by this image that I’d missed the crucial prelude, the process by which his desires crystallize and he understands why he wants to be free: to share a fleeting life with his trapeze artist. In moving to Berlin, I was working (or not working, as the case may have been) on the assumption that a grand gesture was itself enough—that, in the wake of the decision to uproot myself, my true desires would emerge to fill the vacuum. In the nineties Wenders made a sequel to the movie that I’d never seen; the last thing I wanted to know was what happened next.

But I realize now I should have known what would happen next. One of the very first things I’d heard upon arrival in Berlin was a line from the 1920s feuilletonist Karl Scheffler: Berlin ist dazu verdammt, immerfort zu werden, niemals zu sein. Berlin is damned always to become and never to be. It was such a seductive idea, that the city would never grow fusty or calcific and that, by proxy, you would never become fusty or calcific. And if a place was always becoming, there was no time for belatedness, no great era you’d missed out on, no cost to frittering away your time doing this or that. But we were, I was, so easily seduced, I missed the part about damned.

*

For a while there, at the beginning, starting with that Frisbee panty party, things were genuinely fizzy and I didn’t at all mind spending my days just walking around and my nights saying yes to whatever happened to present itself. Just being there felt glorious, or, more than glorious, felt like enough. We felt like participants. The cigarettes, those endless stockpiles of cigarettes, and the coffee really did taste different, as they always do in a new place, and drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes felt like sufficient acts. Cigarettes marked off the time. For the few minutes one lasted, you knew exactly what you were doing: you were smoking that cigarette. When it was done, you would figure out what to do next, or you would just light another.

I arrived in Berlin with ten e-mail addresses. The first person I met, Emilie, looked at my list and said I needn’t bother e-mailing the rest; she knew them all, and I’d see them the next day at the big gallery opening. Her friend Alix was coming along, and I’d love her.

We met at Emilie’s place first, in a cobbled and uncharacteristically pretty street behind Arkonaplatz. Alix’s name was pronounced in the French style, ah-LEEX, and she arrived with a duffel bag big enough for a body.

“Where did you just come from?” I asked. “A trip? Hockey practice?”

“Nowhere,” Alix said. She’s thin and angular and striking, with pointy elbows, long, nervous fingers, and deep-set almond eyes. She has a soft rumpled tide of unruly hair and glows with a cold marmoreal light. She opened the bag and changed in front of us, into a billowy unbelted stained silk dress and Thirty Years’ War–vintage combat boots tourniqueted at the ankles.

The economic, cultural, and psychological draws of Berlin—the sheer amounts of time and space that in other cities would be taken up by day jobs or the steady emotional drain of long-standing friendships; the almost religiously shared belief in the possibility of personal reinvention; and an addiction to the promise of the new—made for a robust art scene, at least according to various multilingual periodicals. This opening was at the new outpost of a huge London gallery. The room, or rather the space—nothing took place in something as banal as a room—had the size and character of a well-swept munitions depot, and probably had served as one once. Everything in Berlin happened in a former somewhere: the former sanitation-technology factory in the Ritterstraße, the former pretzel factory in the Prenzlauer Allee, the dome of the former post office in the Oranienburgerstraße that now had a restaurant/club that would only take reservations via text message to a secret number, the former department-store-vault club that was now in the former basement of the former (current?) power station, and of course the former dentist’s office, which the white tiles heated up like a sauna. All of these rooms had been liberated from their erstwhile indebtedness to productivity.

In the former munitions depot, people dressed in lab coats angled through the crowd with purpose, and I assumed they were caterers. Once I’d become a little more familiar with art, I’d look back and wonder if they hadn’t been part of the installation, or, once I felt as though I knew even more about art, if they’d possibly been both caterers and part of the installation. After the opening we got into a cab and went to a party in Kreuzberg hosted by a fragile, fey artist in a black feathered boa and his bloodshot gallerist, who was wearing a T-shirt that said “Vulva Vaginal Scent” and chewing on lollipops. I texted a friend in San Francisco, described these guys, and asked if they were anybody I should feel pleased to be at a party with. He wrote: FAMOUS GUY SAATCHI ART CAVE OF DICKS. I tried nonchalantly to ask Emilie what CAVE OF DICKS meant and she said that the guy in the black feathered boa had once made a cave of dicks. Actual live dicks. They hung down from unsuckably distant glory holes in the ceiling.
A sometimes-celebrated young conceptual artist who, I was told, was always on the prowl found out I was a writer and asked me to help him craft a text message to a chick photographer on assignment for Vice in Stockholm. He had thick tortoiseshell glasses and whined with refinement. He assumed I was an art critic, as most everyone did when I introduced myself as a writer, and asked me about magazines.

“Have you ever written for Domus? No? But you’ve heard of Domus, right? What about Precept? Not that, either? Yeah, it’s weird, me neither, I hadn’t heard of them until recently. There are just all these magazines, and it’s weird, all of them profile me. And you’re, like, what are you, you know? Are you art magazines or fashion magazines or what, when you profile me?” He named more magazines. “Uovo. Texte zur Kunst. 032c, Bidoun, Monopol, mono.kultur. So many. Texte zur Kunst.”
Alix swooped in and delivered me onto a roof to smoke, though of course you could smoke inside too. She rolled her eyes and promised that there was more to the art scene here than naming magazines. There were, to be fair, some very fine artists. There was Omer, a gruff Israeli who made multichannel video installations; there was the pretty much just Danish guy who made a big deal about being Icelandic and had a dirigible hangar and eighty pretty assistants; there was Maxime, a French kid in his early twenties who shot the kind of harsh and tender photographs one might have seen on Nan Goldin’s Facebook page; and there was Ignacio, who’d spent ten years in an office job making private artworks out of thousand-cell Excel spreadsheets. However, with the exception of Maxime, who had to stay out late enough for his friends to start tattooing each other so he could take pictures of them to put online, the really good artists didn’t seem to go out that much.

“Let’s get out of here,” Alix said, and took me to Bar Drei, where we sat until seven o’clock in the morning. There was no art space in Berlin more interesting than Bar Drei, and it wasn’t an art space at all. It looked like a gallery that had dispensed with the pretext of art entirely in favor of the unimpeachable idea of charging money for the free drinks. It was a fishbowl on a lonely corner behind the Volksbühne and had no sign save a large “3” stenciled on the door. The bar itself was a triangle of black Formica countertop in the center of the room, its vertices rounded off, so sitting at it made you feel as though you were a member of some deliberative post-tribal council of the future. The walls to the street were enormous windows. Everyone went there after the openings, or, as you got smarter about things, you skipped the openings and went straight to Drei, which was like an opening but with chairs. That was all anybody wanted at an opening, anyway, were chairs. The only other furnishings at Drei were black spherical bulbs that hung on cords at even intervals over the bar, like soft interrogation lamps; they weren’t fixed to anything and the only thing that would get you kicked out was pendulating them. Drei hired mostly artists, both Americans and Germans, as bartenders, and part of their art practice—I assumed this had something to do with the art world’s recent infatuation with something called “relational aesthetics”—was never keeping precise tabs. At the end of the night there was always a tense but pleasurable negotiation about the matter of what to pay.

Drei, I came to see as I became part of it, had an astonishingly regular clientele. Berlin was a city where three quarters of the population couldn’t drag itself out of bed before noon, but if there was one place that made people reliable, it was Drei. It was safe to assume that on any given evening, between the closing of the openings and the opening of the clubs, most of the people I came to know would be there. Some people I knew I saw only there. I met David Levine at Drei; and Zhivago, a beefy and voluble half-Danish, half-Syrian installation artist who grew up between Sacramento, Paris, and Valletta, and spoke at least eight languages, all of them fluently, none of them natively; and Carson, the gentle czar of the international-art-expat scene, who ran a noncommercial space devoted to intersections of art and architecture, dressed in sheer and tasteful varieties of drapery, and was always off to Osaka or Cap d’Antibes or Istanbul for a biennial or panel; and the other David, who painted surgically enhanced women in oils with textbook anatomical precision and spent three hours each day at the gym and seven hours each night smoking; and the style bloggers; and the Norwegian video artists; and, a little while later, the younger guys with the Internet-based work. In the summer everyone sat around on the monument outside, the one to all the lost and forgotten monuments, and in the winter the smoke was so thick inside that nobody had to smoke at all.

*

But Bar Drei didn’t open until nine-thirty at night, which still left the matter of the daytime. As far as doing nothing was concerned, if you couldn’t be an artist, you could at least be Jewish; in a way all the Americans in Berlin were honorary Jews. (Many of them were actual Jews.) In the first quarter of the twentieth century the saying used to go that “every Berliner comes from Breslau,” from the shtetls of the Pale of Settlement. They also said that “the Jew comes from the East and has no time.” He was an avatar of restless commercial modernity. These days the Jew comes from the West and has more time than he knows what to do with. He is an avatar of restless noncommercial modernity. I got by in that first year by writing up cranky little dispatches for a Web-based Jewish magazine out of New York that allowed the Jewishness of my content to be glancing.

The main trouble, it seemed to me, was that American Jews and Germans felt as though they needed to say something to one another, but never quite knew what. My mom, a rabbi and a psychoanalyst, came to visit for my first Thanksgiving, and we toured the standard Jewish monuments and memorials. Her feeling about the monuments and the memorials, like her feelings about anything in general, was that it was important to keep the conversation going, that the only way toward healing is through talk. I told her that of course I tended to agree with her, but that the problem in Berlin was that the conversational partners just didn’t match up. It often felt as though Germans over a certain age—twenty-five, say—wanted something from you, some sign that everything had finally become okay. I mostly did think that everything had become okay, but I never felt entitled to say that. After all, I hadn’t any personal connection to the Holocaust. The people who could offer real forgiveness were dead, or they were dying.

The ubiquity of these conversational templates made it impossible to forget I was Jewish. In the States it was something I’d never thought much about, which had always struck my friends as strange. They assumed that I, as the son of two rabbis, would have a strong religious commitment. But my parents had been savvy enough to know that if they made a big deal out of observance, we’d certainly end up defecting; so—with the exception of weekly Shabbat dinners at home and High Holiday attendance and large annual seders—they left it up to us, which meant we’d ended up mostly like normal, suburban, disaffected cultural Jews. Our Jewishness meant Woody Allen and latkes, like anybody else’s.

But in Berlin this ambivalent patrimony was foisted upon you. It was immediately clear that Jews had a certain purchase in Berlin; as David Levine let me quote him in one of my first columns, “They really know how to torque it.” I decided at a certain point that I liked those Jews best who were a little interested in the Holocaust, who liked to talk a few minutes of Holocaust now and then, technical stuff, mostly. These were often academics, like my friend who was writing a dissertation about the few exiles who returned, against their wives’ protests, to help rebuild German universities after the war. But a healthy relationship to the Holocaust wasn’t the norm. Melodrama was easier, more cheaply satisfying, and it was one way to explain to yourself what you were doing in Germany: just existing there was an act of defiance and strength. Being a Jew in New York is a mark of some considerable banality, but being a Jew in Berlin makes you special. You have the Holocaust in your pocket, the run of a city you rightly deserve.

There was the feeling that the Holocaust got you off the hook, only furthering the idea that you were in Berlin to do just as you pleased, sleep with whomever you felt like, even if she had a boyfriend. It allowed you to be contemptuous of the Germans, gave you an excuse to ignore the local culture. Or you could be obsequious, make a big deal out of how little you cared about the Holocaust, how much you despised the “Shoah industry,” how awful the histrionics of Libeskind. Jews like this were ambassadors; they found it in themselves to congratulate the Germans for having gotten over the past, which often—counterintuitively—meant congratulating themselves for having overcome their own fraught Jewish-American identity. It was a gesture of forgiveness that had everything to do with the forgiver and little to do with the forgiven. It was forgiveness as power, as arrogance.

This was all true, in an inverse way, about the Germans too. They reveled in their powerlessness. For them simply not being a Nazi counted as an accomplishment. For decades they had done really fine work not being Nazis—unlike the Austrians, who were still basically Nazis. The Germans had made not being Nazis into a central plank of their identity, and, as with the Jews, that meant they could be absolved of other ambitions.

As uncomfortable as it made me, it was often easiest just to give in to the sense of Holocaust-related entitlement. Sometimes this took the form of standard guilt. When the synagogue in the Rykestraße reopened to great fanfare, I felt I had to go at least hear Kol Nidre, and I did, though I left after fifteen minutes. Other times it took odder forms, like the habit I developed of walking around listening to Paul Célan read “Todesfuge” on my iPod. But most of the time these feelings were desublimated, more crassly manifested. At a birthday party for an Icelandic artist a young and beautiful German Goth reclined in a bathtub. The bathtub was in the kitchen; it pulled down from a closet between the sink and the stove, like a Murphy bed. She lolled against the dry porcelain and told me she’d just finished her degree in   Anti-Semitism Studies, with a focus on the post-Shoah relationship between West Germany and Israel. My friend Max was tall and handsome and obviously Jewish and made a habit of this sort of thing, and I pulled him aside to ask for the encouraging advice I knew he’d give. “The only way we—Germans and Jews alike—will heal these old wounds,” he said, “is if we take seriously our duty, difficult as it may often be, to take women like that home.”

*

The person who pulled off the bohemian thing most convincingly—that is, neither self-consciously nor apologetically—was Emilie, which was funny, because Emilie was also the only one of us who had an actual job—in fact, a whole series of them. The rest of us had come to Berlin to escape the authority of work, but Emilie hustled. She was always on the phone, screaming at someone in German customs to free up a six-foot carved totem from Uttar Pradesh in time for an opening that night; or running a gallery while her boss languished in Moabit Prison on charges of fraud (later acquitted); or curating a genuinely good group show in a former brewery, featuring work by some of our friends and later written up on the style-and-art-blog circuit by other of our friends. But she also managed to party as though it were her job. She worked harder than anybody I knew.
Emilie’s life may have been in a constant state of crisis, but it was never an existential crisis. They were practical crises. Some of them might have landed her in bureaucratic labyrinths or trapped her on Baltic islands with street-art-dealing aristocrats, but none of them ever seemed to make her wonder why she was in Berlin, which was something she could be specific about: she sold art. One of the nice things about Berlin was that you didn’t have to be specific if you didn’t feel like it. If somebody asked you what you were up to in town, you could say you were an artist or just interested in art and leave it at that. They didn’t need to know anything more, didn’t have to worry you were withholding anything, because in part what you were communicating was that you probably weren’t a hundred percent sure what you were doing there. But your erstwhile interrogator almost certainly wasn’t sure what she was doing there, either, so everybody could get away with being broad-brush about things. This obtained in general. Part of the liberation of Berlin in Berlin was the permission to be vague.

Emilie was different, though. She was good at the specific thing she did during the day, knew the right ways to talk to artists and collectors. She paid taxes, had been audited, had an expensive couch she tried not to get too many cigarette holes in. She was also loyal, and loyal in a way nobody in Berlin ever seemed to try very hard to be. She had principles, made a point of never sleeping with anybody her friends had slept with, and never cheated. Rarely cheated. All of these things were of a piece. The rest of us, at a certain point, began to worry that we were going out too much, felt mildly concerned that we were somehow betraying our true selves by not feeling held to account, not getting enough done—enough of what done we could rarely say—but Emilie never had that problem. She got done during the day what she had to get done and she did at night what she wanted to do. She was comfortable with her desire for some things because she was obligated to do others; she was able to oblige some things because she desired others. She bore the same relationship to us that Micah bore to the friends he had in Shanghai—shortly after I abandoned him he put in for a transfer overseas—who were always arguing about whose Mandarin had the best tones. Micah just went to the factory in Suzhou or Zhuhai or Taiyuan and got on with it.

Emilie, so confident about how she spent her time, was the closest thing we had to a true doyenne, and she could have posted up at Bar Drei with the rest of us. But she was cut out for demimonde grandeur, and was delighted to include anybody who wanted in. For a while Emilie dated an endearingly feckless East German named Kevin, a sweet case study in the most extreme psychological effects of the nanny state. Kevin was notionally a DJ, but sometimes he was so busy partying, he would forget to play music; when he remembered, though, everybody had a good time, and even when he forgot, it was okay. At the beginning we’d hang out in his studio—he was also, notionally, a photographer—and he’d spin records. He and his studio-mate called the place the Bernsteinzimmer, the “Amber Room,” after the alleged hoard of still-missing Nazi gold. His DJ name was Kevin9/11 until Emilie forced him to change it. Then he called himself Kevolution. Emilie sighed and gave up.

They had a pretty good relationship for a while, one mostly based on mutual respect for the intensity with which the other could party. Their terms of endearment were party related. “Du bist die Partymäuschen,” they would say with affectionate accuracy. “You are the little party mouse.”

At four-thirty one December weekday morning, at the close of what felt like my first semester in Berlin, we left Kevolution behind at the Bernsteinzimmer to play or not play records as he continued to see fit. It was Alix’s birthday and we were near the Prenzlauer Berg–Pankow border. Emilie had heard about a new club, and six or ten of us were wandering around in the chilly dark looking for it. As we walked past one of the entrances to the Mauerpark, a disputably green zone where a strip of no-man’s-land once was, she noticed a single votive candle on a sidewalk. She swerved into the black lane. Someone asked where she thought she was going.
“There’s a party in here,” she said, gesturing ahead of us into the dark. Someone asked how she knew.

“Did you not see the votive candle? Whenever you see votive candles, you follow them, and they take you to a rave.” We followed the votive candles a kilometer into the park. The tree branches stitched a starless canopy against the black sky. Somebody picked his or her way along in heels. We tried to turn back.

“Do whatever you like,” Emilie said, “but I’m going to this party.”

“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and shivered.

We walked for twenty more minutes, rounded a corner, and came through a copse to a Weimar-era toolshed. Inside there was a spectacular rave, with several rooms of music, an enormous amount of barely nibbled Turkish Fladenbrot, hundreds of people.
“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and we went to dance. We left Emilie there at eight thirty in the morning and took the M10 tram in a wide arc back to our side of town. The streets were just beginning to steep in the squalid sub-lactic half-light of a winter Thursday. Commuters read nationalist tabloids of anti-immigrant sentiment. Alix folded herself under my arm and fell asleep, I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, and life to me felt almost unbearably full.

*

There was some pretense, in Berlin, of sexual adventure as part of the never-ending audition in recklessness. A close friend, Jordan, complained that his cohort, all the pretty young ubiquitous art boys, had developed an orgy habit, and that he wanted no part in it. He was conservative, he said, and did not like to sleep with his friends; he just wanted a monogamous relationship with a nice man. He was twenty-three and modeled part-time; he spoke seven or eight languages, including Arabic and Polish and Japanese, and I was constantly telling him to quit his gallery job and get into a linguistics PhD program, where he belonged.

Jordan seemed to have healthy, unconflicted relationship to his sexuality, and we spent a lot of time talking about my dad. I told him that the main thing that had changed since my father came out was the innuendo. Actually, “innuendo” isn’t the right word, as it implies subtlety. There are many things for which you, or, more specifically, I, could reasonably blame my dad—deceit, say, or the sustained fantasy that a decade of complete and utter irresponsibility was the least the world owed him—but subtlety, especially about sex, is not one of them.

When I was a kid, there had been signs—mostly in his flickering moods—that he had another life. After he came out, everything was explicit. When I was in my early and mid-twenties, during the periods in which we were talking to each other, I would come through New York and we would meet for dinner or a drink in Chelsea. We would walk past a bar with blacked-out windows and a studded leathery stegosaural bouncer and he would roll his eyes and say something like, “Oh, God, the Rawhide. You really gotta keep your back to the wall in there.”

These stories made good anecdotes to trot out for my friends and girlfriends. They worked because they relied on the idea that I might have been expected to feel bad but instead took in the whole thing with detached amusement. My wacky gay-rabbi dad and his crude hijinks, I would imply, as if I were starring in the most progressive of sitcoms. I did not experience detached amusement. The innuendo always felt to me like bragging—bragging about the open eroticism of the life he led now, in contrast to his old, straitjacketed existence at home. This was, to some extent, the transparency I’d always wanted from him, but now it only made me feel lonely.

In turn I made a big deal about my endurance. The first time he took me to a gay bar, a New Jersey mansion dive in teak paneling and threadbare velour with the characteristically unimaginative gay-bar name of the Raven, I asked for a beer, he bought me a Cosmo, and then he walked off to greet some friends he and Brett had met at a club in Fort Lauderdale. I stood in the corner and sipped my Cosmo—I figured he was watching out for my carb intake—and did my best to avoid eye contact with what I was later told were called trolls. The next morning I called my then girlfriend, the one I’d hung around in San Francisco for, to complain about how exposed I’d felt under so much perverse late-middle-aged male scrutiny.

“Welcome,” she said, “to what it’s like to be a woman every single day.” I told that story for years, and the moral I made of her punch line was that everybody feels vulnerable sometimes and you ought to just get over yourself. In Berlin I went to gay bars all the time—which wasn’t hard, as in Berlin even the convenience stores often felt like de facto gay bars—to prove that I’d gotten over myself. For me this was the point of my dad’s Rawhide references: Get over yourself.

When I talked to Jordan about this, I was both looking for sympathy and trying to needle him; I was in part proud of my dad’s candor, his ability to be so unashamed of his desire, his apparent lack of hang-ups. “Jordan,” I said, “aren’t you selling out the revolutionary promise of homosexuality? What about the idea that the ethics of sexual loyalty is a hetero hang-up your kind has gloriously overcome in favor of the ethics of betrayal?” What about Genet—what about his sense that the traditional monogamous relationship was “something of a protection racket,” as Adam Phillips put it in a review of an Edmund White memoir. I promise to pretend as though you’re the only thing that could possibly make me happy, it says, and you promise the same thing, and we’ll surely make each other miserable. Genet’s counterproposal on behalf of his generation of homosexuals? An intimacy of anonymity. His idea, Phillips writes, was that “so-called relationships were the place where one needn’t take anything personally.”

Jordan was unfazed. “You just say that because you only fuck girls with boyfriends and you want to find some intellectual reason to think that’s okay, and because you know you yourself are dying for exactly that protection racket. You can’t stop looking for the perfect girl. Anyway, as far as gay people my age are concerned, what you’re talking about is the big problem with what your dad’s generation did to our generation. They grew up trying to be straight, so when they could finally fuck men, they went all crazy about it, and they still can’t stop fucking, and they’ve saddled us with the idea that gay life should always be this creepy free-for-all of fucking. But I’ve been gay since I knew how to talk, and all I want is my boyfriend and my dog, Miss Tilly, and a nice duvet and some DVDs. If you want to call that a protection racket, go right ahead, doll face. It’s what I want.”

But there was still a part of me that felt as though I had to grow up and into the ethics of betrayal, that part of coming to Berlin was getting over petty jealousy and the childish desire for an impossibly complete presence, and what felt so terrible so often wasn’t the old sadness and jealousy but the guilt about still being hung up in the same old ways.

The only artist who made work that seemed to address, in a serious and useful way, what was going on in Berlin—the absence of authority, the tyranny of desire—was David Levine. David was tall and muscular and perpetually stubbled, his jaundiced eyes open wide in frequent disbelief, and he spoke with a dark, feathery rasp. In summer he wore frayed wifebeaters and in winter thermal undershirts and motorcycle boots with the ringed trusses clipped off. You could imagine him smoking while working out, smoking while swimming. We had friends in common in New York, as everybody else did, and he had impressive and successful ex-girlfriends.

David was an experimental theater director and conceptual artist who thought the two worlds had something to learn from each other. Performance art had given up on the idea of rehearsal because it thought that authenticity could only derive from spontaneity, from unself-consciousness, which could make a performance feel uncanny and novel. But the authenticity part is always a red herring, David used to say. Well-acted, well-directed, and well-rehearsed theater could be just as moving, or as alienating, as any given performance-art tantrum. If you rehearse, if you employ all the traditional techniques the theater uses to create credibility, and only then take away the scaffolding, you could perhaps make something that would split the difference. Art doesn’t want to be seen as trying very hard, but the trick of the theater is that sometimes it’s only when you’re trying as hard as you possibly can that you seem effortless. David practiced forms of ritualized improvisation, or improvised ritual.

His first really big piece—called Bauerntheater, it had been written up at great length in the “Arts & Leisure” section of the Times—closed shortly before I arrived in town. He’d rehearsed an actor in the role of a potato farmer in a previously untranslated Heiner Müller play about East German agricultural collectivization in the fifties, then put the guy in a field about an hour outside of Berlin and had him plant potatoes in full costume in the regional style of the day. He’d gotten a large grant from the German cultural ministry to do this, and it had gotten him a lot of good press. An arts journalist friend of his wrote yet another thing about Berlin artists for a Manhattan magazine, and the big pull-quote was David’s. It concerned the differences between being an artist in Berlin and New York. “In New York,” he said, “if you’re not making a hundred grand and sleeping with a lesbian, you’re nothing.”

At Bar Drei one night after the story came out, he seemed distracted and I asked him why. “I’m worried,” he said, “that the story is going to piss off the lesbian I sleep with when I’m in New York.”

Alix put her cigarette out. “And I wonder if it’ll also piss off the German cultural ministry that made Bauerntheater possible by giving you a hundred grand.”

*

David Levine’s next project after Bauerntheater, the first one I was around for, was called The Gallery Will Be Relocating over the Summer. It was a fake art opening that took its name from the fact that the real gallery that hosted it was supposed to be relocating over the summer. Then the gallerist had a kid with a young Spanish artist, starting posting about the Andalusian weather on Facebook, and was never heard from again. The fake opening was a final project for his students in a class he was teaching at the Freie Universität. Each student spent an entire semester studying the habits and affects of an art-world person—an artist, curator, gallerist—and showed up in character for the performance at the gallery, in the Brunnenstraße. All the newer galleries back then were in the Brunnenstrasse and they would coordinate their monthly openings in a way that turned the street into a block party. These were my favorite evenings of that first year—drinking free beer in the nine p.m. sunlight, parading around in the street, knowing that everybody you knew in the whole city was on that block and was going to an after-party where everyone was there and nobody ever left—though the art was rarely very accomplished. David liked to say that the Brunnenstraße was where everybody got a chance. He didn’t mean that cynically.
“The most important thing to remember,” he said to me through the smoke at Bar Drei the day before his fake show was set to real open, “is that every artist is always making the best art he or she possibly can. You can call it bad art, if you want, and most of it is bad the way most of anything is bad, but there’s no grace in impugning the motivations behind it.”

I felt greedy and often impatient for these lopsided moments with David, moments of instruction and clarifying tenderness and even the occasional reprimand. Over time I tried harder not to press him into a vigilance he was neither interested in nor prepared for, and I was eager for chances to reciprocate, to show him I was just as interested in friendship as I was in oversight. So I was happy when David asked Alix and me to write the fake press release for his fake show. We took the job very seriously, spent hours outside at the Turkish bakery working on it, but in the end our draft wasn’t all that distinguishable from the real press release.

The fake opening had fake-real art on the walls, inspired by the real art of the characters under study, and real free booze, and a nonnegotiable locked-door duration of four hours. At seven p.m. David bicycle-locked the front door of the gallery. The only person inside in character as herself was an arts reporter in town, a friend of a friend whom we’d introduced to David at Bar Drei. He’d invited her to appear in the piece as herself, and she was flattered. “You’re like Peter Falk in Wings of Desire!” I said. She frowned.

The real opening, i.e., the opening of David’s show, was in the courtyard outside, where we milled and drank the same free booze the fake people were real-drinking inside. Occasionally we looked in through the window to see what the fake attendees were up to. What they were up to looked largely the same as what we were up to, which was part of the point, but we were afraid that they were having a better time. After all, they had been licensed by hard work and careful direction to spend a few hours being different people, which meant they were drunkenly rolling around on the floor and wrecking the artwork and making the most of it. This made an even better point. We were ourselves at a real event, which meant our hearts weren’t in it, not the way theirs were. We were freer, but they were surer of their roles and we couldn’t help but look over our shoulders at them.

The night was warm and there were a lot of free drinks and the after-party sounded increasingly auspicious and it had been a while, I realized, since I’d had such a nice time out at yet another art function in Berlin. The doors to the fake opening were unlocked at eleven. The New York arts reporter playing herself came out and held up her BlackBerry. Someone we knew in New York, or someone some of us knew and others had heard of, had gotten three quarters of a million dollars for his novel, which apparently included whimsical drawings. This was somehow not surprising, that news of ambition and focus and whimsy-related success in New York had come via the one New York media reporter playing herself inside a well-directed fake art opening in Berlin. It was the real toad in the imaginary garden.

The real news from the fake opening had seemed an ill omen. I’d been in Berlin for a year and had no better idea what I was doing there than I had when I arrived; the mere lifting of constraint had not infused my life with purpose, and I did not feel any freer than I had in San Francisco. I’d come to Berlin at least in part to escape what I saw as a kind of generational malaise, and had discovered there a slightly different kind of generational malaise. It had simply become a nonstop moral holiday, and we lived in it, and there was always someone in town from New York to show off for. This is an alternative to waiting in line for cupcakes, was the implication. Two friends visited and had a threesome with a tied-up Swede. Another friend came and cheated on her boyfriend with a twenty-one-year-old male model who was writing his undergraduate thesis on Heidegger. They came to see dawn and to cheat and we took them out and in the process allowed ourselves a great time we didn’t have to take full responsibility for. But as time went on we felt less and less great about it. We finished the night at seven in the morning, long after the sun had risen too early and too hot over the river at Bar25, at eight in the wintry morning coming out of Berghain long before the sun painted its gray on gray in the slushy sky, at ten in the morning at the Mauerpark flea market before you’ve been home to sleep, at eleven in the morning taking a regional train to a crummy Baltic beach to doze it off. The visitors were always ready to go home after an amazing week. It was their vacation but it was our life, and it no longer seemed like what I’d wanted. At that time there was a song lyric that did not stop running through my mind. “You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan / and the next five years trying to be with your friends again.” I wanted old friends and Micah and meaningful work and to sleep with a woman I was in love with and to wake up in the morning. I wanted the innocent life I’d had in San Francisco but this time having had the experiences I’d had in Berlin.

Even the spaces felt different to me. I no longer saw the aesthetic appeal of the postindustrial. We’d been pleased that the dilapidated buildings still stood, thought that the ruination—as opposed to Belle Époque elegance, or geometries of steel and glass—was a mark of our cold grit. But once things started to go bad, it seemed to me that we’d let the past persist merely to burlesque it. We sent up its quaint striving with athletic derangement. We kept the past around not for the sake of continuity but for the sake of rebuke. For a few months when I was out on my Middlemarch-avoiding walks I was drawn to the posters at bus stops asking for donations to shore up the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche. It had been built by the second kaiser in honor of the first one, and was mostly wrecked during the war. Since then it had been fastidiously maintained in its ruination, that it might stand as a warning. Every time it got too ruined, they had to beg the public for money to fix it up a little. It was a lot of effort to preserve an ideal state of decay. The effort involved seemed so pointless.

“I think I’m having a crisis,” I said to David as we walked to his after-party. I felt sheepish about casting him once more in the mentor role, especially on the night of his big success, but it was probably exactly that big success that made me feel I needed so much from him.

David fished a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it for me. “Of course you’re having a crisis. Look, everybody is having a crisis all of the time. You either feel like you’re too tied up and thus prevented from doing what you want to do, or you feel like you’re not tied up enough and have no idea what you want to do. The only thing that allows us any relief is what we tend to call purpose, or what I think about in terms of direction.”

You deal with the crisis that is life by obeying some authority you despise, the authority of money or the authority of relationships or grad school or the authority of cupcakes, and in that case you’re freaked out all the time because you feel like you’re always being thwarted, or you deal with it by renouncing all authority, and in that case you’re freaked out because you’re entirely thrown back upon yourself all of the time in a way pretty much nobody can handle. The main problem with desires, Berlin made clear, is that they’re not nearly as authoritative as we wish they were.

A sense of purpose allows for both the comfort of obedience and the dignity of autonomy. It represents relief from feeling servile and relief from having to worry at every moment about what, precisely, we think we might want right now, what costs we’re willing to pay. The question is: How can you find some structure that allows you to begin to understand what you want without forcing you to pay constant attention to the fluctuation of endlessly conflicting desires? And how can you realize that, whatever the situation, you’re probably already getting what you want on some level, whether you know it or not?

“Everybody is in a crisis all the time,” David finished, “and everybody, at the same time, under some sort of cover, is also pretty much doing what they want. Life is the crisis of doing what you want. Which means: Hold people accountable, but try to be understanding. Nobody gets off the hook just because they’re in a crisis, but you can have sympathy for them as they hang on it. The hook, I mean.” We reached the bar and he lit another cigarette.
Just before we entered the bar, he turned to me one last time.
“You are in a crisis, and you are also doing what you want.”

*

Eventually our crises began to resolve themselves, or maybe it was just that we’d grown bored of these particular crises and were ready for different ones. After one long week of inventive partying, Emilie called Kevolution from their apartment and asked when he would be home. It was ten to midnight on a Friday. “I’ll be home in twenty minutes,” Kevin said. He walked in at ten on Monday morning. Emilie threw her glass of orange juice at his head, narrowly missing an Alec Soth print worth ten thousand dollars, and asked where the fuck he’d been.

“Unterwegs,” he said. Under way.

Emilie broke up with him then, or maybe it was a little later, and Kevin was furious. He took back all he’d said before.  “Du bist nicht die Partymäuschen. Du bist ein Scheiß-Ami-Bitch.” It was cruel, but he knew he’d lost something good. She moved on to a guy with a job, a guy who could afford to go on actual vacations instead of trying to live in one.

Alix, for her part, was also moving on, going to graduate school in New York and some measure of stability and routine that, she feared, would drive her bonkers. She kept her place in Berlin, though, just in case. At the time I was happy for her and sad for myself. I’d thought I’d gotten used to the transience of the place, the constant new crashes and rescues that changed the demography of the shipwreck, but I hadn’t. At least not in her case.
Right around the time she was leaving they were closing the Building, some sort of artist-run space with wishy pedagogical ideas in the back basement of a supermarket wedged in between some East German tower blocks. For their final weekend of events, the people who ran the Building had invited their constituents to take an hour and do whatever they wished with it. Alix called her hour “The Event at the Building: Pedagogy as Potentiality in Reverse” and wrote a press release for it. It was to be listed as a lecture with a voguish description. The audience would file in and Alix would hand out boards and paper and charcoal and present a live model, and the people who expected a lecture on Rancière would have an hour of drawing from life.

Unfortunately for Alix, the Building’s press release, which Alix had long relied upon for its inanity, was in this case perversely clear: it went ahead and revealed the surprise. Alix tried to cancel the class, no longer saw a point, but her nude model was insistent. Alix wrote me a frustrated e-mail. “The model won’t not get naked. It’s part of her art practice, she says.” Until then nobody knew the nude art model had an art practice.

The nude model with the new art practice asked if I would document her nudity textually as part of a future project she was considering, on intimacy. Weren’t there going to be photographers there, I asked, not to mention a whole room of people drawing your nude figure? Yes, she said. But she wanted a text. Sort of like a live blog without the Internet.

I shouldn’t have been at all surprised, but by then I was so tired. Everything in the art world required extensive documentation. They didn’t believe in preparation, but they did believe in proof. I wondered then if the difference between people who believed in preparation and those who believed in proof, like the antagonism David described between those who believed in rehearsal and those who believed in spontaneity, wasn’t the difference between those who worked constantly for something that would endure and those who sought to capture something that occurred once. In Berlin photographs were taken of performances. Writers wrote about the photographs. Bloggers posted about the writers. Installation artists installed pieces about the bloggers.

Performance artists performed in the installations, hoping to get photographed. Photographers shot pictures of the bloggers, hoping to get in magazines. The Berlin Wall had existed primarily on television and in magazines. Berlin galleries existed primarily in Frieze and the social diary of Artforum.com.

Despite the confusion of the uncharacteristically lucid press release for the Event at the Building, most of the people were somehow surprised by the revelation that the fake lecture was going to be a real drawing class, which led one to believe that Alix was actually the only person reading these press releases in the first place. Everybody took it seriously. These were people who were very comfortable with their spectacular emancipation, but it had been years since they’d drawn from life, if they ever had. Everyone was quiet and absorbed and Alix shone like her crazy aunt Terry as she directed the changes in pose. She was immensely pleased.

At Bar Drei afterward we all felt clearer than we had in some time. David was inspired, and talked about his own version of a drawing class. He said he always thought about going back to actual theater directing, if he could do what he wanted. We ran out of cigarettes and walked out, past the Volksbühne, where he’d recently taken me to see Frank Castorf’s version of A Streetcar Named Desire. He called it Endstation Amerika—the Williams estate refused to let him use the name—and it lasted five hours. Kowalski was a grizzled Polish biker with roots in Solidarity. There was nudity and barbershop-quartet Britney Spears, and at one point Mitch forced Blanche to read off some stage directions from the supertitles. The actors may have been drunk. We’d both found it a shade too long.

“You know what the single most radical thing I could do in the Berlin theater would be?” David asked as he looked up at the stolid engaged columns of the Volksbühne. “I’d put on an old-fashioned naturalistic staging, in full period costume, of The Cherry Orchard.”

But pulling that off was going to take some time and a lot of preparation. The last show David put up while I still had an apartment in Berlin was called Hopefuls. It consisted of a few thousand headshots and cover letters seeking actor’s representation, which he plastered with hidden logic on his gallery’s walls. The point of all this was to represent the actor’s commitment to plasticity, to potential. One of the cover letters said that the actor had been told his range extended from Hayden Christensen to Halle Berry. This was because he was, he went on, “ethically dubious.” These were people campaigning vigorously for direction, and we needed to see them as gauche because we so acutely felt the same way. They were all doing the best they could to do something they cared about, and very few of them would succeed. We were doing as little as possible and pretended being in Berlin made us better than them. I stood in the room full of headshots and each one seemed to say, “I must change my life.”

We took out our frustrations on Berlin’s attempts to resemble New York. A lounge called Tausend opened up under the S-Bahn tracks near the Friedrichstraße station. Tausend means “thousand,” and it was not at all a Berlin name. A Berlin name would be “One” or “Two” or, at the very most, “Six.” Tausend also had a strict door policy, which was unusual. The night it opened David sent me a series of texts. “SHOCKINGLY NY 90S.” “I’M SITTING ON A GRAY FELT BANQUETTE.” “BLACK LEATHER CAR COATS OVER WHITE V-NECK T-SHIRTS, AND ONE PORK-PIE HAT.” “JAMIROQUAI.”

The whole point of Berlin was that there was nobody from college who worked in finance and asked if you rented or owned, nobody who blogged about media gossip, and no places like Tausend. Which meant that when a place like Tausend opened, it suggested that perhaps Berlin was over. But then Emilie would take us to the Damensalon, a former cosmetician’s in Neukölln with a bare interior, a plywood bar, and a vast sub-basement dance floor, and it was clear that nothing was over, that the very idea of a place being over, just like the very idea of a place being hip in the first place, was absurd. It had everything to do with the person saying it and nothing to do with the place itself.

What the word “over” really means is that your expectations of a place, your fantasies of who you might have become there, have been confounded by the persistence of you. You want a place to be strong enough to resist the patterns you force onto it, and there are places that can do that for a while. As it became increasingly clear that my era of inconsequence was not going to end in Berlin, as I’d anticipated, and as it had for Wenders’s angel, with the new taste of coffee—with, that is to say, the ability to feel as though what was in front of me was enough, the strength to sit alone in a room and not wonder what was going on in other, secret, more crowded rooms—I began to hope that it might end with Berlin. If moving to Berlin had not left me altered, alert and grateful and decisive, perhaps moving away would. Or perhaps just moving with direction would, waking up each day knowing I had committed myself to spending daylight walking as far as I could toward Santiago de Compostela. I didn’t actually care about what it meant to arrive there, or at least not the way a religious Catholic might. The word “pilgrim” comes from the Latin per agrum, “beyond the fields,” and for a long time in a lot of places it was pretty much the only pretext you had to leave home. I didn’t need a pretext to leave home, but I did want an excuse to have a series of structured days. I thought it might be a redemptive exercise in pointless direction, and I hoped in the end it might give me a better sense for where I stood.",576162,en,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1697817458

Only Way to Fly,country,Charlie Worsham,2017,211,,"That boy is baggage, draggin' you down
Shoulda left him in the lost and found
Solo so long, you're lonely now

You're jonesing for a piece of open sky
A little bit of runway shy
It's high time you kissed gravity goodbye

By the seat of your blue jeans
On the wings of a big dream
Leavin' them smoke rings and the clouds behind
Your co-pilot is your heart of gold
Watch the world disappear below
Come on baby, don't you know?
That's the only way to fly

A leap a faith and gonna launch yourself
Pick a star right off the shelf
You'll be over the moon by sunrise

A tailwind and a little grace
Will get you all the way to outer space
So mission control it's T-minus ten, nine, eight
By the seat of your blue jeans
On the wings of a big dream
Leavin' them smoke rings and the clouds behind
Your co-pilot is your heart of gold

City Of Cold,rock,Raised Fist,2009,870,,"
We live in the city of cold
And even though i have to admit
That sometimes we love to spit on it
But i would take a million bullets for it
The centre of this story
And when I quit, to commit to the pit
And when I've stopped to transmit
Bury me in a hole under my favorite tree
Wait a bit, say goodbye
Put a fucking lid on it and split

We live in the city of cold
Strangely enough we're proud of it
When at home burning the flag
When away living in a bag
Getting mad, feeling sad
City of cold


On with the shoeshine
Stepping on those fucking toes
Now and forever
On with the shoeshine
Stepping on those fucking toes
Now and forever
The city of cold where you can't grow old

And when I quit to commit to the pit
And when I've stopped to transmit
Bury me in a fucking hole
Wait a bit, say goodbye and off you go

We live in the city of snow
So small and cold
Five hundred years old
No stories untold
No one is in control
Sounds cute I know
Small city with snow, one street, no flow
And even though I mostly hate the snow
Now and forever
It 's better then hating people I don't even know


On with the shoeshine
Stepping on those fucking toes
Now and forever
On with the shoeshine
Stepping on those fucking toes
Now and forever

And even though I mostly hate the snow

It 's better then hating people I don't even know
(Now and forever)
And even if you want your own fame to grow
(Now and forever)
I wouldn't talk shit about people i don't even know

One foot in the darkness
Still reachin' for the light

The fate would lead to this
A connection I have finally found
With just a single kiss
Knowing you're the only one
I don't wanna live without
Is all that matters now
It's all that matters now


I'd give my life for love
I'd give my heart away

I'd find another way
I'd take it to the end
To somewhere high above
And in my dire end

I'd give my life for love

I was just a lonely one
Then you took my hand
Led me to another place
Where we could start again
And now I'm on the other side
I've finally found the truth
That I was lookin' for
Now and forever more

For exchange of your life
The reckoning is slowly eating me away
Just run as fast as you can
Don't ever look back on what I've become
In your mind everything seems to make sense
In reality you're painting on an empty canvas

I stand for what I believe in
Restoring faith for the shattered mind
Healing those who've been condemned
Holding onto everything I've got
I'm never going down without a fight

This is a sign of a new beginning
Where all the traits are left to be burned
Just sit back and wait
With the road you've paved for yourself
You make it hard to concur

I am fearless because I recognize illusions from reality

The Moment I Feared,rap,Slick Rick,1988,13538,,"
Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stiff
So I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
And I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my truck jewelry
Cause I'mma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid? Take the shits off man!
The fuck is up?""


I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of furious fists caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
In one of his cars, I think this one's a Riviera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Place that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a band-aid kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""


Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yep, he had poor Sarah's underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
But now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...

It's too late to argue, it's already past 3
A.M. in the morning man, this is T-Painful for me
Hearing you trying, striving, to compare you with me
We're in different circles so stop and venn diagram me
Push you off, who do you think you are
Touching my arm?
Subterranean, too below me
To walk on the ground that I'm on
Sike, no ground, all air
Nike, I'm all victory
I'll just do it when I want to, yeah you'll all see
Name's Sheath, don't forget cause I'm just like a sword
My rap's too sharp, too potent like a poison to give you all...

Back from the dead, but it's only the beginning
Set hell on fire, now I'm gunning for heaven
Shooting up the haters, this ain't no amateur hour
F--k Kanye, Kendrick, and Jigga
I'm running through them like Tim Hightower
Is it a bird? A plane? Nah it's just a beast
Kryptonite ain't got nothing on me, I'm tearing off of this leash
It's a cold world out there but I got J's on my feet
So when I kick you around, blood will surely fill the streets
A realistic, narcissistic misogynist with no fears
When I spit on the mic you know that the end of days is near
But don't get me wrong, I'm filled with holiday cheer
But unlike Santa Claus, I don't come once a year
Till I collapse
I'm popping caps in her ass
Off in Mexico with Mr. White cooking glass
Hit the gas!
This beat is almost over, but guess what?! *Laughs*
She's still bent over",331101,en,https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1697817458

Started dreamin' overtime

Here's my heart
Take my hand

Chillin' drinking beer with my boy John Swan

Sitting next to LS Mark giving Verdis Joe a Brofist
Walking in the door all the goth and black girls ask

Eating Emplemons while I'm drinking Neoncaffine

In a foresome all while CallMeCarson's yelling ""please, no!""
Started tripping and I ran right past

Running just as Quinton entered up the goddamn wall
Ducked down just so I could hit Drake with the Dragsaw

The Art Of Letting Go,pop,Kenny Loggins,1997,77,,"There are times
When love soaks you to the bone
'N then those moments leave you wonderin'
If you'll lose your mind or lose control
Life is nothing without love
Love is nothing if not freedom
They tell me the gates of hell
That you shake 'n you rattle
Are secretly locked from inside
You hope 'n pray you'll find
The one thing on your mind
Not until you know
The art of letting go
'N it may seem to be
Defying gravity
That's because they know
The art of letting go
You may think
You built a present perfect world
And you may wonder to yourself
Does anyone really know what else could ever matter?
But the man with his hand
On the hammer
Wears a velvet glove
Does the rich man know he's poor?
Does the beggar care for much more than survival?
When you look into the eyes of children laughing
Do you remember who you were?
Or who you are?
Life is nothing without love
Love is nothing if not freedom
They tell me the gates of hell
That you shake 'n you rattle
Are secretly locked
From inside
You hope 'n pray you'll find
The one thing on your mind
Not until you know
The art of letting go
'N it may seem to be
Defying gravity
That's because they know
The art of letting go
You hope and pray you'll find
A love to last all time
Not until you know
The art of letting go
And it may seem to be
Defying gravity
That's because they know
The art of letting go
You're dying to believe
In love eternally
Not until you know
The art of letting go
And it may seem to be
Defying gravity
That's because we know
The art of letting go
You can't go through it
Without going through it

'Til you know the truth",1481103,en,https://images.genius.com/bee8630e39b7a172af5415e411846248.600x600x1.png
Kenesaw Mountain Landis,pop,Jonathan Coulton,2003,1712,,"
Kenesaw Mountain Landis was a bad mother fucker
He was seventeen feet tall, he had a hundred and fifty wives
He didn't do that much except he saved the game of baseball
He put two and two together and he noticed it was four
Now the treachery of Shoeless Joe can't hurt us anymore
And he'll always be remembered as Kenesaw Mountain Landis


Fellow named Joe Jackson was a fielder for the Black Sox
And he always wore his black socks, but he never wore no shoes
He weren't the nicest fellow and he had a couple problems
Cause he drank a lot and he beat his wife and he always acted rude
He killed and ate some babies and he copped an attitude
And the one man that he hated most was Kenesaw Mountain Landis


The mafia said Shoeless Joe
You should really run this show
You should be the guy who owns baseball
And all you really gotta do
Is help us make a buck or two
We'll bet on the other team
You'll lose the game but make it seem
Like nothing could be further from the truth

Shoeless Joe did what they said he dropped a couple fly balls
And he walked up to the pitcher and he poked him in the eye
And in the seventh inning with the Black Sox nearly beaten
There was someone who was watching from his blimp above the stands
Cradling a rifle in his thick and meaty hands
And as if you hadn't guessed yet it was Kenesaw Mountain Landis


Kenesaw said drop that glove
Or I swear by God above
I'll make you regret playing baseball
Shoeless Joe looked up and saw
Silver rifle's gaping maw
And though no one had noticed yet
His underwear was getting wet
He peed himself in front of everyone


Shoeless Joe was finished but he couldn't quite admit it
So he raised his middle finger up above the other four
And Kenesaw took careful aim and fired a single bullet
And he shot that dirty finger off and he dropped his trusty gun
And everybody in the stands knew that he had won
And today they still refer to him as Kenesaw Mountain Landis

Shoeless Joe left baseball and became a famous pop star
And he asked the musical question ""Is She Really Going Out With Him?""
He had a couple albums and a comeback in the 80's
But he never won a Grammy and he never was the same
And he never could be satisfied with critical acclaim
Cause the critics all confused him with the great Elvis Costello
Yes the critics all confused him with the great Elvis Costello",1776929,en,https://images.genius.com/3394c14eff90fca8d1693d08133dddc4.1000x1000x1.jpg
Railing,pop,Roni Size / Reprazent,1997,2096,Dynamite MC,"Yes, something of a different pace
Fresh, It's a 97' made taste
Now, I believe the time is right
How, stepping from the left to the right
So get, ready for the rhythm in check
Direct, believe me you ain't heard nothing yet!
I will, volunteer my lyrical skill
Until, the score reaches 50-nil
Go deep, Right into the middle of the beat
It stays sweet, in every way, 7 days a week
Untied, give it to you line by line, the source is the power of the force in the rhyme
It's new, structure of this our unveiling, Go twice around the waters still keep on sailing
Panic, so get confuse I can't shake it, Feel Static, built up by the charge in the break
I can't have it, I need true spirit Reprazenters, a skilled ever ready strong team of inventors
And I got that, that's why my beats sound so pure, 'cos its the format, something you've never heard before!

Do you think that you can hold on, when the beat gets too strong and you feel that you need help to move along
Do you think that you can hang tough, when the rhythm gets rough and the DJ says ""I think you've had enough""
Do you think that you can digest, when I start to digress, better get yourself a lyric proof vest!
Do you think that you can compete when you hear the fat beat, you need stamina like an athlete!
Unique, continue the future technique to full heat, let the microphone burn when I speak
Alright, now we're getting into this sound, pick it up, shake it up, turn it upside-down!",1370693,en,https://images.genius.com/6651e36fbf6d2069505a13d75184f70b.600x600x1.jpg
The Chase,rap,Salience,2013,363,,"
I'm sharp like a pencil
You gotta get a ladder just to get up on my level
Never had the time to deal with being sentimental
'Cause I'm busy ripping beats and all these instrumentals
Time never wasted, never bother father time
Live off mother earth, and I'm reaching for the sky
Work before play, forward then rewind
Feel I never get a break; get the chance to go and vibe
'Cause I'm busy in this life tryna make me some success
It seems it's all measured based on the zeroes on my checks
Life is a girl when shes playing with her breasts
She's a tease and I'm thinking I can't wait to see what's next
Living for adventure, dying for the pleasure
Come fit in my shoes if you think you can do better
I know that I'm not perfect, but I put forth all my effort
Living life to the fullest 'cause it doesn't last forever (ever but)


I'll do this shit forever
Any time, any place
You disparage my work
You best be believing I'll get down in your face
After everything I give it
I'm getting no return, but I still put in faith
I try to live my dreams
2 years in the making, I am down for the chase

I gotta believe
Smoke and mirrors all around me making me deceived
But I know that these illusions make it difficult to see
So I close my eyes, say goodbye like I hit delete
So come and take a seat, let me show 'round my planet
Life gave me a promotion; it’s a little hard to manage
But I make it work if I gotta do it single handed
I'm taking flight, getting high, not coming down for landing
I'm the pilot speaking, and were reaching to the height of cloud 9
If you don’t wanna follow me you can take a step outside
I'm in shape and I'm loving your outline
If time is borrowed, I'll rent for two 'cause it's our time
I know persistence is key to surmount the hurdles
You cut the corners and it comes around full circle
I'm moving through the ranks, you could say that I am colonel
It's a hare’s race, so don’t even bother 'cause you're a turtle, uh

x2


After everything I put in
My heart, my soul, my mind, I give up countless time
And I know, I'm getting blocked out, I'm just waiting to shine
You can push me down; you'll never take whats mine
'Cause all my writtens, are coming from the dome
Headphones blasting with a microphone
You can't stop me when I'm in my zone
And there's no one here, it sure feel like home
Working all the time so I can live my dream
I think I'm king only when I breathe
I'm thinking of success 'cause it's in my genes
I'll make it to the top and I'll get my green
I know I said it once, but it's not about the paper
I just wanted to relish the fruits of my labor
Success is essential, I can't rely on failure
Rap is dying slowly and I'm its only savior (savior)

In Our Hands,misc,Eleanor Roosevelt,2016,8,,"“Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighbourhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerned citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.”",2829717,en,https://images.genius.com/630a2b7e032f5810f44b9cafcfdea2d3.640x400x1.jpg

And in that bloom, there are we (Yuh)
So can you open your eyes and see (Yuh)
That bloom is a part of me (Yuh)
We the Sons of Edmund, let it be (Ha, Ha, Ha)
Cool guy (No)
Strong guy (Yes)
Let's go back to old days
I'm still on my usual place
Been a good week – have clear space
Been a good life – still not a disgrace
So papa please stop screaming (Ah)
Don't you know I made it out alive?
Don't you know He rose the third day (Alive, yo)
So I breathe for him, what else should be done
Don't mess with the Sons, unless you want to be gone
Constantly sinning, 'cus the blade is all withdrawn
Always repenting, 'cus I wanna see the dawn
But I'm a Son of Edmund, don't you know?
I'm a Son of Edmund, let me show you how

Growing up, climbing up
Never stop, gonna make it to the top
Thuglife is the life to be
We the sons, will always stand with our tree


It's that growth that made this anthem
If you diss Him, hold me back or I'll be attem
Hold me back, and I will pray for 'em
Don't they know that God died for them?
Yo, that's where I got my stem
Can't you see I grew under there?
So much taller, but always near
He has ridden me from all fear
So
Cleanse me in this wildfire
'cus my soul to cold it's dire
No, let me never tire
As I keep on walking
God let me keep on talking
Of you as I face these men
And knock it out like Tyson
Let me finish with an “Amen”
'cus the kingdom is yours now and then
Stop talking of a when (Only now)
So when I gotta repent? (Now)
When I gotta praise him? (Now)
When I gotta raise his name up? (Now)

Yeah, so char this beat in holy flames",6401032,en,https://images.genius.com/a25e5601600131eca1257c1ff5ed6d31.500x500x1.jpg

It keeps creeping up my spine
Just a human's life deficiency

I want to disappear
What reason can I find, what reason can I find?
Swallowing the things I can't control

What happens when they come and violate my inner sun
What happens when they try to smother all behind their eyes?
Will I still justify those goddamn lies?

Inhale, deny, the stains inside

The angel comes inside

Of all their problems
And what they have done
You think they listen to you
You're so easy to see through
The big decision, is who to impress
Hiding the fact that
Your life is a mess
You lie to yourself and deny
For fear of what's inside

Not a reason to believe in
And it hurts to know
That it's all show
You're more important than we could know
For what you've got in mind
Who could ever be with your time
It hurts to know

Every possesion that you'll ever need
All of your vision's been blinded by greed
No one can offer enough
You say you've had it rough
Asking me favore and not an apology
For sick intentions
That people don't want to see
Only lookin for more
What are you living for
Not a reason to believe in

It's been so long since you admitted you're wrong
Did you forget that you're human
But the need to belong just keeps on bringing you back
Are you avoiding the fact
That I won't be coming home?

Friends don’t eat friends but y’all was always on pretend
Smile all up in my face turn around and they offend
I was deaf, I was blind, stayed loyal, always kind
Didn’t argue, had no time, thought that stuff was one-time
But it followed in a pattern didn’t realize that it mattered
Cause my brain was all scattered, like some glass it was shattered
Then I finally knucked and bucked and I had to reconstruct
Start a code of conduct cause I finally had enough
Sick of giving up my trust, speak on my name like it’s dust
My reputation tried to crush, you could never get enough
I think it’s time the tables turned and you face all of the drama
Like Queen sang to Chris I think it’s time you got your karma

Friends don’t diss friends and that’s where all this had to end
Cause I was coming up on the trend while y’all was tryna make amends
I returned like a fool, but this was only high school
I ain’t had nothing to lose, but my time, which was abused
I had help from other friends, who had came to my defense
They helped my mind make some sense, helped me build a mental fence
I got what I deserved, my old lesson now learned
Heal my ego which was burned, my importance now confirmed
Got no time to be deceived, ain’t no playbacks, no repeats
My greatness, guaranteed. I’m a leader, a supreme
It’s like it hurts but it doesn’t, thought we were close, guess we wasn’t
Never switched up, always consistent, you changed up, was acting different

The Upside of Goodbye,pop,Michael Nesmith,1972,312,,"There was an element of majesty
In the way the lady said that she
Was leaving in the morning for the coast
And that goodbye should have brought me pain
But I watched her quickly check the reins
Of emotions which unloosed would cripple most

Then the thing that struck me strangely
Was the feeling that I had when she was gone
The few that left before had left me empty
But she'd left me with a fullness to lean on

Then the thing that struck me strangely
Was the feeling that I had when she was gone
The few that left before had left me empty
But she'd left me with a fullness to lean on

So the bitterness that usually set in
Was effectively undone by the girl's uncommon grace
And the thrust of the experience
Was the enrichening and lively sense
She gave to my life and to its pace
I don't know where she's gone
Her wanderlust surely was strong
But love would be made much more sure
If all the ladies leaving left like her
If all the ladies leaving left like her",1531193,en,https://images.genius.com/c27f042c027f9b0343e09cf0a785005c.640x640x1.jpg

Yo!
Its Big Jak
Suck on my sack
Still in the basement
Cracking kids backs


I'm Big Jak
Coming with a third
Drop your pants and
Unleash that turd
I shit on the mic
To cause a distortion
I fucking hate kids
I'm now pro-abortion

That dumb bitch just
Shitted and Farted
My parents claim that
I'm mentally retared
My mother says that
I am a fool
Show wouldn't be saying that
When i shoot up my school
Checked my undies
Oh look some skids
Hoped in the car and
Ran over some kids
Don't know how
Many I hit
Three maybe Four
Now I got parents
Knocking at my door

Joe Seaman
Is a piece of shit
Got some nice ass tits
For a punk ass bitch
The Joe starts sucking
Bitch I'm ducking
I ain't down for this
Gay ass fucking

Now I'm on the run
Hiding in my Ford
They wanna take my
Ass to court
She came on me
So I came on her
And felt like shouting
Her racial slur

She was freaky
I felt so alive
Too  bad that she
Was Five
It's Big Jak that
Big Jak this
How about you  all just
Suck on this dick


Crash the Lambo
Shit was too fast
Lock myself in the chamber
And turned on the gas
I'm a ladies man
Babies need to die
Why does that woman in
The bar look like a guy?

Now just leave
Give  me some space
Come too close
I'll Splooge on your face
Saw an old hag
Hit her with my car
I make better music
Than IDR
Sniffing these lines and
Popping these pills
Whip out my knife
And rank up these kills
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Still got these massive nuts
To bust

I eat ass
Still can't fucking read
Down at the park is
Where I like to breed
This is the end
It's been a while ride
Now it's time for me to
Commit suicide


Thanks for the support guys!
But it's the last song
I-I'm gonna kill myself now!
Goodbye!

Some things are best forgotten anyway; that's what they say
But I know I never could forget
This town is part of me
How could I let such an experiences flee?

But I want to know such more, behind this building's locked up corpse
But what I see is a graveyard of what it used to be

The way that they smile, seems so empty to me
I know what my father wanted them to be
What are they hidding from me?

He was the congregation's vagrant
With an unrequited love
When your passion's exaltation
Then finding refuge is not enough
She was the youngest of the family
And the last to be let go
When they decided they would try
And make it on their own


Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Where'd you go?


When July became December
Their affection fought the cold
But they couldn't quite remember
What inspired them to go
And it was beautifully depressing
Like A Streetcar Named Desire
They were fighting for their love
That had started growing tired

Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Don't fade away




When the money lost momentum
And the bills were piling high
Then the smile had finally faded
From the apple of their eye
They were young and independent
And they thought they had it planned
Should've known right from the start
You can't predict the end


Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away
Oh, memories, where'd you go?
You were all I've ever known
How I miss yesterday
And how I let it fade away

Where is the shore

I won't give up without a fight

The waves are coming at full force
And even though I thrash about
It only makes it worse
I only get more tired

Have I gotten out so far

A sickle in a cotton veil
Will I make it through this gale

Was it very far from here
Nothing but the water sounds
And if I had it in a glass
I could drink it down and laugh
I would laugh and drink it down
The water is so pure tonight
It brings you life yet makes you drown
The fish must be laughing

I have seen the boats of steel
I have used a fishing reel
I am bobbing like a cork
In this never-ending dark

I am soaked from toe to chin
I will not let the water in
Is there any use at all
To fight against this heavy tide
Will it take me in its stride
It's such a long swim
It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim

I was sitting in the sand
Waves were tumbling with the wind
They pulled him out
They pulled him in
The stretcher brought him back again
The sirens let the swimmers know
Not to wrestle undertoes
It's such a long swim
And now there is no sign of land
The breakers are behind me now
Splashing in a hopeless flow
Far above the muddy sand

Will I dry off on the rocks
Will I ever see the docks
The beacons must have all burnt out
I am flooded with this doubt
It's such a long swim

It's such a long swim, it's such a long swim

You're half way there

Lack of hope?
No way to cope?
Sorry to say
I believe in you
That loneliness
Is all you have?
But you know what?
It's not your fault

Someday we will talk all night
Of all that we've been through
No more tears no more sorrows
Only your brightest smile

Someday we will laugh all night
About our hardest times
Until then we'll hold our hands together, soft and tight
Together we'll move on


Now wipe your tears
You don’t deserve
Will you show some smile?
Oh please, for me
Don’t blame yourself
Don’t hate yourself
You can be rude
You can be mean
I know you will
Be back in a while
To where we used to
Hang out a lot
I like who you are
I like who you are
I like who you are

Losing focus I've been stressed out
And my senses failing head full of doubt

Tell me why it hurts so bad
Meant nothing to the times we had
This feeling that I couldn't make sense of
Out of place shedding tears when it's all lost


I try and try, not a single time you're satisfied
I cry and cry, saddenеd till all my tears dried
What's the point of trying? I don't know
My hеart say yes but my body says no
My heart froze, see-through crystalline snow
You tell me I'm not worth it, was it all for show?
Moncler on me ice-cold
Hug me baby promise I won't let go


I'm so fucking stressed feels like I got nothing left
Funny how I'm at my best when there's something to distract
Feels like I can't catch a breath there's always something next
Don't want calls, don't want texts, I don't wanna interact

Maybe I could try again

I can't do this by myself I could really use a friend

Path in the Snow,pop,Big Scythe,2004,64,,"Nothingness has roamed here tonight
I haven't experienced another life
So darkness preached it's the only way
Existing in life disguised

Into night
Suddenly all turns to ice in the cyclons
You realize a path in the snow near your feet
Tombland, it will be yours
Noone knows that I'm here

Path in the snow
That's the way we want to go
Mysteriously I found a ring
In the realms of forbidden kings
Entering forbidden caves
I'm keeping a secret in me
Darkness is leading me
Into night

Youth is a gift someone brought it to me
Like the winds of '94
Hear the mystic sound of the ocean
I roamed here so long ago
Home again I feel free and life
Has come back to fill up my senses
Struggeling during years of night

Leaning back, straight relaxed with my feet up on my desk

Floods a wave of immense emotion
Bears a shadow so frail that it shakes

That fades away
Your just a fading coward
The last mistake
Of a life that sinks deep to the floor
Tell my shadow the curse of it’s weight
With a voice now unbroken
It calls my name
With the daylight over
No breath to take
Shed the weight of immense emotion
Have no shadow that falls to the wake
Let go the memory the moment
That cause your pain
I’m just a fading coward one last mistake
And I’m not giving up

Take me for
The trident of all your means

Business, maximize money, go for self
Never felt for all the ones who need help, I melt ‘em down
Crown myself the best, success right to left, my trophy shelf
Healthy competition gets rid of all the kids who ain’t got it
And then I pocket what I got ‘cross bottom lines on the dockets
But with all this talkin’ of profits, I forgot ‘bout my purpose
The real prophet walked the Earth, planted his church below the surface
Takin’ everything I could used to be my thing
Now I bring financial backin’ with no interest or strings
‘Cause somebody’s gotta give the gold to serve the world’s new
King…

As the keeper of the knowledge, I act snobbish
If it ain’t college and polished, then your claim ain’t solid
Demolish all of your assumptions, somethin’ real in my appeal
I think therefore I am, and you can’t trust what you feel
I deal in chemistry, biology, math and astrophysics
Designs smash the asanine, data defined in digits
But there’s limits to every system, so when I heard that He fixed ‘em
I ditched my whole no-soul tradition, and joined up on His mission
Casting doubts from iv’ry towers used to be my thing
Now I hit sickness and hunger in a worldwide sting
‘Cause somebody’s gotta know the truth to serve the world’s new
King…
As the keeper of the power, I devour armies
At alarmin’ rates, massive harm, disarmin’ your states
Success is based upon the carnage I take, carpet bombin’ with squadrons
Shake the Earth, then recreate, I’m claimin’ my space
Forsake my brotherhood, I’m goin’ to war, stockpilin’ stores of
Weaponry, effigies made then settle the scores
But we’re only fightin’ the foes our real enemy chose
So I defeat evil in droves ‘til the gates of hell close
Transition
Shock-and-awe, death, destruction used to be my thing
Now I supply man and machine to get it up full swing
‘Cause somebody’s gotta build it all to serve the world’s new
King

Three kings, one mission, ‘cause we finally see
What the Creator, Most High, has designed us to be

That you're my every dream
Yet, you're afraid each thing I do

A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart

Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold, cold heart



There was a time when I believed
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more we drift apart

I can force a laugh
I can dance and play the part

Give you all I am


I can do it

But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
Cause I'm only human

I can turn it on
Be a good machine
I can hold the weight of worlds
If that's what you need
Be your everything


I can do it
I can do it
I'll get through it


But I'm only human

Just a little human

I can take so much
'Til I've had enough

Crying as I leave, worried by the webs I'll weave

Still we fall in love, and it's the fall I'm thinking of

Pimping ain't easy, trust me, I know when gangstas and hoes
Go, go, go, go, go, go, together
Like chinchilla and bad weather, I'm good, but been better
All my bros get cheddar and glamorous things
Copped a few cars, a crib with east and west wing
'Cause this is how I'm living and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it, how to prey on my weakness
The power of P-U-S-S-Y
Got a lot of niggas wondering, it ain't just I
Gotta keep your cash coming and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got

Sip Seraphim, who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-N-C

Closest to the arches, but live in a fortress
New Benzes, new Porsches, new cases, new lawyers

Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
It's no wonder that I'm still here
Thought I was gone, but I'm still here
And all you bitches that left me here
It's kinda funny how you right back there

Through all these years, done had your kids
How could you wonder?

And all the crying and the pain, who'd you run to?
Now tell me, baby, do you still wonder?
'Cause I'm that chick from I-.N-C
Some try to front, but them chicks ain't me
Straight to the top, you all gonna see
All my ladies say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh""
It's no wonder why we still here

You didn't think that we would be here
Ain't no mistaking, this is our year

Ezekiel 31:2: Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
Ezekiel 31:3: Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
Ezekiel 31:4: The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
Ezekiel 31:5: Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
Ezekiel 31:6: All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
Ezekiel 31:7: Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
Ezekiel 31:8: The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
Ezekiel 31:9: I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
Ezekiel 31:10: Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
Ezekiel 31:11: I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
Ezekiel 31:12: And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
Ezekiel 31:13: Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
Ezekiel 31:14: To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel 31:15: Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
Ezekiel 31:16: I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
Ezekiel 31:17: They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
Ezekiel 31:18: To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword.

When Were Both Old  Mad,pop,Paul Kelly,2019,614,Kasey Chambers,"
When we're both old and mad
We won't care much what we say
We'll be younger everyday
We'll laugh when we should be sad
We'll laugh when we should be sad
Ride our bikes down to the bay
Goin' home we'll lose our way
When we're both old and mad


When we're both mad and old
We'll live in a house chock-full of books
We'll lose each other for days in nooks
Then find each other to hold
We'll find each other to hold
Feed a few too many pets
We'll forget that we once had regrets
When we're both mad and old


Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
La-la la-la-la

When we're both old and mad
We'll wear our jumpers inside-out
We'll think we whisper, though we shout
We'll wink when we're feeling glad
We'll wink when we're feeling glad
Ride our bikes down to the sea
Swim like dolphins, you and me
When we're both old and mad
When we're both old and mad

Love is a Chain,pop,Greg Brown,2015,60,,"If you're free, stay free
If ya ain't free, git free
But if ya' can't git free, join me
All my life I been bound in the chains of love

An' I said to myself I would leave
Said I gonna travel an' just do as I please
An' I stood with my back to you, darlin'
An' we both ended up on our knees


Love is a chain
Love is a chain
Though I try to fly
Off through the sky
But here I remain

Many times I have gone to the depot
Jus' to listen to the departure times
I was thinkin' of all the places I would love to go
An' gonnaleave everything behind
Ah, but I know I could go to the moon
To the cold side where everything is dark
But I'd still see your face before me
An' I would still say your name in my heart

In case the silence came
They took the quiet hand
That waited
At my throat away
The cold percussion
Of all these man-made things
The rhythmic scream of trains
That automate
The life in things
But I never wanted
To see the timely rain
To know precisely how
The chemistry
In feeling drains
I ask no sinewave cycles
And no repeats
From time
I can't see answers in
The accidents that chaos finds
I should have seen it  amidst the broken things
That lost their meaning when analysis was everything
There is no voice of Venus amidst the steel and grey
And Im impatient for the things that make me move again

All the stars are in the wrong place at the wrong time

Strolling,rap,Son Anthony,2019,9,,"
When I woke up and she was there right beside me
Last night was fun but I'm still unhappy
When putting on my clothes she asks me where is it I'm going
Told her I don't know where yet and I'll tell her when I've found it
The way the sunlight filled her room was comforting
But it felt a little off like how all my days start
I'm used to waking up alone and drifting off the same
And returning to the world where they don't know your name
Get a move on. Shake a leg. She asked me if i wanted eggs
Kissed her forehead and told her save that for a rainy day
Then I grabbed my keys and went to give her a cat a pet
Walked on out of her apartment with strong feelings of regret
That's the regimen. Better men have fallen worse than I have
The branded lettering on my soul reads ""tragic""
I just graduated and I need some time to rest before
I'm thrown out the house like Uncle Phil did jazz
We are human and we're known to thrive off interaction
Some more than others. Some can't stand to have it
If ever you find yourself in a conversation
Do you stay to hear the person out or plan to walk away?
How would you like to be ignored?
Shit, I don't think I'd blame that other person if they end up getting bored
For I am a broken record full of hiss, pops when played
While beating a dead horse over hip hop breaks

We can stroll around the globe forever
And if I'm being honest I'm not sure what we will see
The only thing that matters is that we roam together
Let's go for a walk and get lost
If it starts to rain we can run for cover
And when it's nice out we can soak that sun up
The only thing that matters is that we roam together
Let's go for a walk and get lost


I overthink the future during times when it is crucial
Procrastination specialist that wrestles with his due dates
Fugue state survivor after being bang zoomed
Who Mufasa told ""remember"" to
Reactivating centrifuge of medial lobe functions that return me to me
Honestly I much preferred being leagues beneath the sea
After I beseeched a hug from someone I would see
Late at night when I felt lonely who now want's nothing to do with me
Jovial refusal knowing that I'm truly doomed
So all I can do now is just walk away the blues
If my shoes could talk, they would beg me to stop
Blacktops and hilltops, on cold days and hot
Traversing around the block and forest to get my steps in
To walk it out like Unk to avoid suppression
With my heart out I'm requesting you to take my hand
And walk and talk with me so

We can stroll around the globe forever
And if I'm being honest I'm not sure what we will see
The only thing that matters is that we roam together
Let's go for a walk and get lost
If it starts to rain we can run for cover
And when it's nice out we can soak that sun up
The only thing that matters is that we roam together
Let's go for a walk and get lost",4837729,en,https://images.genius.com/c50c198149b925b13cb99a2ad425b295.1000x1000x1.png

In groups of three
Fast girls walk slow
On side streets
Sometimes the girls who walk alone
Aren't found for days or weeks

On the busy boulevards
Bad boys call you names
And cruise you hard
Bullies laugh and grin and beat
Your soft skin against
The cold concrete

I'm 3,000 miles away

Make you bleed
Make you cry
And make you think
I'll die here soon if I don't leave
If I don't leave if I don't leave

Take turns to push and pull you down
Forget trying to live and be happy
I'll take safe and terror free

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Hit the floor
Shut off the lights
As the bullets fly
Terror rules the dark night
Dogs hang from the trees

These training ground for punks and thieves
Home of poor white retirees
Who didn't bail
And couldn't sell
When color made the grass less green

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
Apples are filled with razor blades
But fools and innocents believe
That love and faith and truth and beauty
Can make a garden of this human factory

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Leave home alone
No trace or clue of where they've gone
Sometimes these girls are never found
Never found never found

I'm 3,000 miles away

Burn In Hell Lyrical Righteousness,rap,Christopher Bonilla,2015,18,,"7 demons on your shoulder
Sin one more time
They get stronger
Sin again
They grow larger
Jesus came for our salvation
But over time that too gets harder
Questions pass by our mind like
""Why even bother?""
Therefore make a effort to comprehend that Hades is waiting
To take your soul for the taking
While the Grim Reaper is putting a price on your soul
That is 7 times cheaper
And is causing you to fall deeper into sin
And almost forcing you to no longer be a believer of the One
True Teacher
So think twice when you are conscience about sinning
And who you are forsaking
While you are claiming to be a Master of debating your thoughts
Of Self-Confidence to Holy-Obedience
AS if though you're about to go on your own
And just as you are about to open the door to explore salvation
Satan pulls a lever for you to fall through the floor
Into a place where you become his whore
And of course it burns
Right to the core
Especially when he stabs you multiple times with his bloody horns
And so your flesh is torn
And you end up doing his dirty chores
With no stop
So then you have over excessive sores
Working alongside another dead corpse
And for a fact you don't want to feel this pain anymore
And right before the devil is about to take you fully
The Holy Spirit is someone God cannot ignore
So He shouts a mighty roar to bring you right back up
To tell you He loves you very much
Even when you fail
Or even when you feel you're confined in a cell
Because in all actuality
God doesn't want to see any of us

What awaits him down the path, he will then have to choose

As they search they are always asking questions
What's out there? What's waiting for them?
Why was I made? Who made me?
And what did they make me for?
Are you gonna go up into space with your old man or not
Maybe I'll never get all of this

In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction,pop,Idlewild,2002,3396,,"In the beginning, there were answers
Then they came along and changed
All these questions and their answers seemed to change

So I'll wait 'til I find the remote part of your heart
When Nowhere else will let us choose a comfortable start

We stop in every passing place
To watch the world move faster than we do
Watch it pass with our eyes closed the way we usually choose to

So I'll wait 'til I find the remote part of your heart
When nowhere else will let us choose a comfortable start
And even if the breath between us smells of alcohol
We call it confusion in the best way possible

It isn't in the mirror
It isn't on the page
It's a red hearted vibration
Pushing through the walls of dark imagination
Finding no equation
Theres a red road rage
But it's not road rage
It's asylum seekers engulfed by a grudge
Scottish friction, Scottish fiction

It isn't in the castle, it isn't in the mist
It's a calling of the waters as they break to show
The new black death with reactors aglow
You think your security
Can keep you in purity
You will not shake us off
Above or below

Places,rock,Slacker Justice,2019,17,,"It's just another lonely night
I find myself in these strange places
I wanna know if I can be
Everything that you expect

I miss you and all the things
That we'd do more than ever now
And it's true that nothing's the same without you
Please take me back again

Last night I sorted through my room
I found a picture of us hanging
On the wall above my bed
What I would give to have you back

So keep my body alive
Keep me fed and keep me nourished
I wanna live another day
I wanna sleep another night

I miss you and all the things
That we'd do more than ever now
And it's true that nothing's the same without you
Please take me back to when
We’d talk about life
Like to talk about love
Like to talk about fear
Why don’t we talk about being
Unsure about life
Unsure about love
Unsure about fear
Unsure of how i’m feeling

When we’d talk about life
Like to talk about love
Like to talk about fear
Why don’t we talk about being
Unsure about life
Unsure about love
Unsure about fear
Unsure of how i’m feeling

That we'd do more than ever now
And it's true that nothing's the same without you

Warning Signs,pop,Kimberose,2021,362,,"
That time you said we'll be forever more
Now it's ringing in my head
Those games we played ain't funny anymore
Now we're faking it instead


New lies will come tomorrow
New ways to deceive


You better
Read the warning, see the warning, hear the warning signs
Heed the warning, see the warning, hear the warning signs
One life, one chance, one shot at romance
You better read thе warning signs


Oh, oh, oh-oh


Those songs we sang sound so out of key
Dеad melodies
Damn, it's so strange, things change so quickly
How could I not see it coming?

New lies will come tomorrow
New ways to deceive


You better
Read the warning, see the warning, hear the warning signs
Read the warning, hear the warning, see the warning signs
One life, one chance, one go at romance
You better read the warning signs


Oh, no more
The ship has left the shore
Oh, we can't ignore
This ain't like it was before

Klô Pelgag - Où vas-tu quand tu dors? English Translation,pop,Genius English Translations,2020,53,,"
I sleep with knives in the living room
I play with fire, in front of it I melt
I'm the one who wakes up sleepwalkers
I want to know where they go


Where do you go when you go to sleep?
You, who doesn't even know how to dream
Your blue eyes turn black
Where do you go when you sleep?


You run fast for someone who doesn't like to walk
Are you looking for a new person to resemble?
I am the one who leads the walk of the sleepwalkers
I will show them wherе to go


Where do you go ?
Wherе do you go ?

Where do you go when you go to sleep?
You, who doesn't even know how to dream
All your dreams become nightmares
Where do you go when you sleep?

Go down moses,pop,The Lower Lights,2015,767,,"When Israel was in Egypt's land
Let my people go
Oppressed so hard they could not stand
Let my people go
Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh
Let my people go
No more shall they in bondage toil
Let my people go
But let them come with Egypt's spoil
Let my people go
Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh
Let my people go
The LORD told Moses what to do
Let my people go
To lead the Hebrew children through
Let my people go
Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh
Let my people go
As Israel stood by the waterside
Let my people go
At God's command it did divide
Let my people go
Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh
Let my people go
Oh let us all from bondage flee
Let my people go
And let us all in Christ be free

Off Broadway,country,Ryan Adams & The Cardinals,2007,235,,"
Hanging 'round Broadway and I think I saw your face
Cars speeding by me reminding me of us
Rats scurry from the gutter to their holes
All these people they're trying to get home


And I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
Used to be off Broadway


I miss your locket and the things you kept inside
And I just can't stop it, it hasn't killed me yet but give it time
Shuffle down to the watering hole
Getting tired and I want to go home


I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where that is anymore
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway
Used to be off Broadway

I don't know where that is anymore
I don't know where I live anymore

The New Desire,pop,Mortemia,2010,118,,"This condemnation revages all the sanity in me
This flagellation you all brought upon me
You come with fire, with stakes and your torches burning
A new desire, a flaming prophecy

This convocation, a vile and dark conspiracy
An oppression of all which is free
A new desire, a destined path for you and for me
And all others who once were free

A waning desire, all hope led astray
Now darkness consumes the day
A sign and a token, wisdom unspoken
Gives fuel to the flames",1303968,en,https://images.genius.com/b0906299adb11df3095e15ef06827953.722x722x1.jpg
